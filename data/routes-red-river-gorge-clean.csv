Everything about it seems classic to me, exposure, moves and overall appearance. It does seem stiff for the grade, keep in mind it was downgraded from 5.12 when the anchors were lowered. What really ups the exposure on this climb is the last bolt which is ~12-15 feet above the second last bolt. High feet and a long reach to a side pull/underclingand is needed to land the clipping stance here. If you're not a 5.11+ climber you'll be doing this as a dead-point. If you miss the move you'll be in for a long fall (clean though). I've watched the mental and physical stamina drain from many unsuspecting climbers as they realize the whipper they are about to take if they miss this final difficult move. I can't say I feel 100% mentally with it either going for the hold, haha.  \n\nApr 3, 2017"", 'hometown': ''}, {'user_id': 'zachary-burton', 'username': 'Zachary Burton', 'body': 'I have a question for everyone.

Easy moves between slopey pockets leads to a gnarly little slab crux involving a sharp 1/4"" crimp and a sidepull mono.  Above this a series of jugs lead to a great rest below the intimidating overhang.  Follow massive jugs up the steep wall to a difficult move getting to the 3rd bolt on the overhanging, then more jugs to the redpoint crux: one not-so great pinch just before reaching the arete.

Suddenly I was at the crux.  I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.      At that moment everyone at the base of the cliff took notice and went silent.  I launched into the crux and I remember cheering from below, but they sounded very far away.  Barely hanging in there on the sidepulls and back and forth foot switches, I eyed the finishing ledge.  It seemed really far away.  My gas tank was empty and my forearms were at red line.  In a last ditch effort, I shifted my hips and launched for it with all I had.  I brushed the juggy ledge with my fingertips, no other appendages on the wall.  I hung there in space for what seemed like forever, then I was suddenly speeding towards earth.  I thought \x93This should not be happening!\x94  The next thing I knew I was on the end of the rope a long ways down.

I dunno if there used to be bolts and they were cut or I was misinformed. Definitely doable in one pitch with a 60m but I have a pretty light rack so I decided not to. Built a gear anchor in the crack at the ledge to save the tree and belayed from there. 60m gets you down no problem but make sure you have a middle marker.   Edit: Since this post, bolts have been added at the first belay ledge in addition to the bolts up top. You can now do this in two pitches with no gear anchors and rap off the second set of bolts with a 60m or do two raps off the anchors.

Easy moves between slopey pockets leads to a gnarly little slab crux involving a sharp 1/4"" crimp and a sidepull mono.  Above this a series of jugs lead to a great rest below the intimidating overhang.  Follow massive jugs up the steep wall to a difficult move getting to the 3rd bolt on the overhanging, then more jugs to the redpoint crux: one not-so great pinch just before reaching the arete.

Without saying anything to my belayer, I pulled onto the wall.  I climbed through the lower sections multitude of pockets swiftly, using the path employed by the other climbers.  Suddenly I was at the crux.  I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.      At that moment everyone at the base of the cliff took notice and went silent.  I launched into the crux and I remember cheering from below, but they sounded very far away.  Barely hanging in there on the sidepulls and back and forth foot switches, I eyed the finishing ledge.  It seemed really far away.  My gas tank was empty and my forearms were at red line.  In a last ditch effort, I shifted my hips and launched for it with all I had.  I brushed the juggy ledge with my fingertips, no other appendages on the wall.  I hung there in space for what seemed like forever, then I was suddenly speeding towards earth.  I thought \x93This should not be happening!\x94  The next thing I knew I was on the end of the rope a long ways down.
