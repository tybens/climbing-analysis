After a few hundred yards or so you should be able to see the maintenance yards or stables below you. You will also see below you a rockfall/wash or drainage. Do not go directly down the drainage. Continue following the trail a bit further, it will gradually start to descend and then doubles back toward the drainage. Then the trail serpentines (some boulder-hopping) down the drainage to the ground depositing you behind the stables. The descent took 40 minutes.

Getting to the lower falls pools:   From the top of pitch 3, you have the option of either topping out or keeping a keen eye out for the horizontal climber's trail that runs across the ascent (it's easy to miss if you're focused on climbing).   -Topping out involves 250-300' of dirty choss scrambling upwards and is not very fun. Once you reach the top, hug the slab and go right down an obvious gully. At the bottom of this gully it turns into a downwards gully that goes to the cliff. Follow this down till you see the obvious climber's trail to the right, and take that trail.   -If you were looking out for the climber's trail on the way up the choss, you should've spotted it in less than 100' of scrambling up. This is the same trail taken in the first option - if you are facing upwards, take this trail left towards the falls. It is pretty obvious the whole way, although there's a couple offshoot trails that dead end pretty quickly. Once you see the pools below, just walk down and slightly right across the slab, then sharp left near the bottom for an easy boulder downclimb. Time to enjoy cool, refreshing water and amazing views!   Once you've enjoyed the falls to your hearts content, there are a few descent options:  -If you brought two 70m ropes, you can rappel down the falls from the station near the waterfall itself.   -If you brought one 70m rope, you can walk back to the route itself, downclimb a bit and rappel from trees either down the way you came up, or sharp right over the cliff into the gully (this sharp right is from the top of pitch 3). There are some hidden-ish rappel rings in the gully as well. While this can be done with one 70m rope, we hit the ends of our rope twice and had to use some smaller trees as intermediate rappel stations, so I don't necessarily recommend this option.   -Walk off by taking the climber's trail in the other direction. I did not take this option, so can't give very detailed instructions, but I was told it is past the gully I described in the beginning. You should be able to see a talus field as well as the stables if you go this way. This is the ""sketchy"" descent described in the comments multiple times.

The crux of this climb for me was route finding.    I screwed up on the first pitch. I read go left at the flake and I took it too literally and went left up a ledge/crack to a large tree... not the large tree I was looking for. The top of the first pitch is on the top right of the crack/gully. Extra pitch off route aside, the rest of the climb was fun.    I also had to pause at the top of the second pitch--looking up there are two cracks that look climbable: go up the right one until you reach an obvious and very exposed right traverse on a ledge. We set up a belay on gear in a small crack on the traverse ledge. There was a fixed nut there which I was glad to see. The crack takes some nuts and tiny cams.   The third pitch goes up a corner on the right of the ledge with a tree sticking out. From the top of that corner, there are a bunch of slabs with some cracks. It looks like there are several ways you can go here. I went up a weird slab with a small crack. Eventually you reach a flat-ish area with a bunch of hilly slabs. I probably should've set up a another belay on a tree here, but I went further up a bunch of runout slabs with a ton of rope drag.  I nearly ran out of rope on a 70m rope when I finally set up a belay on a ledge with a manzanita about 15 feet below the trail. In hindsight I definitely wouldve should've set up an intermediate pitch.    We couldn't see the trail even from 15 feet below it, so I scrambed up a very short final pitch to the obvious trail.    The descent was terrifying. The trail going left toward what I think is supposed to be pools or the falls was wet and exposed; I took one look, said no thanks, and started heading right. The trail was relatively easy to follow, but often leaves you wondering if you missed some easier turnoff somewhere. We had no other beta than to keep going right, so that's what we did. The trail is narrow, loose, and terribly exposed. In hindsight I should have stayed roped up for a lot of it. There are a bunch of sections on narrow dirt paths where a small slip means instant death. I was seriously terrified and starting to ponder what my mother would think if I slipped and died. Eventually we reached a series of wet slabs and ledges, which again caused some pause. I went down to the bottom and saw a narrow exposed path, which I cautiously proceeded while my partner waited on the top ledge. This is where I spotted the trail and a large boulder-filled gully.   After a long and nervous hour or so wondering if we were going the right way, we finally realized the worst was over. From there the trail got a lot more slippery, but was not exposed, so a fall would only mean some scrapes. We came down the far side of a large very cool gully filled with giant granite boulders. This was definitely the most relieved I've ever been to set foot on a trail and see tourists walking around.    Definitely going to look for repel options next time.

For p1 after about 50-60 vertical feet, I belayed at the wrong tree on a ledge (first tree on the right), then we scrambled up 15 more feet to the 2nd tree on the right to start p2, right before the narrow slot in the gully.  P2 had ""obvious cracks"" on the right that were only about 8' tall, leading to a ledge and unprotectable easy scramble to another ledge. This is where we didn't know where to go, but we finally decided it was on-route. On the 2nd ledge there was a flake to the left (looked like 5.7/5.8 layback or hand jams?), two protectable cracks in the middle (that started about 8' off the ledge), and a boulder move to a ledge and a tree on the right. We took the easiest way up, the boulder move on the right.  From there, p3 offered 3 ways up: some broken cracks to the left near the gully, the big crack/dihedral in the middle above another small tree, and some easy face moves with small cracks to the right. 2 of us went up the crack/dihedral (BD Camalot #2 and #3, maybe also a #1?) and the 3rd went up the face to the right.  After that was the traverse to the right (can place a cam in middle of traverse to protect follower) to the tree then up a hand crack. Above that I placed a BD gree 0.75 then had a choice of a hand crack to the left or a fist crack to the right, leading up to a small tree where I ran out of rope (60m) and belayed. The party ahead of us had a 70m rope so continued 30' higher to belay from a small manzanita.    from the small manzanita, can scramble up to the trail (some 5.1 to 5.3 slab moves) or belay someone up as a 4th pitch, but there's not much protection for a rope until you reach more big bushes right below the trail--can belay someone up from there if they are not comfortable soloing it.  At the top, there are two trails going left to the pools; the lower is a little sketchy but the upper is chill. Do not try to enter the pools when the waterfall is flowing!     Walk-off trail to the right was tedious but not dangerous--if you choose the right path (tend left/uphill whenever possible), it only runs right next to the cliff edge about 3 times but there is a rock shelf that could be wet with flowing water early in the season. Descending the rock gully is slow and annoying but not dangerous if it's dry and you take your time. When you get to the first gully, cross it then the path immediately descends along the far side (left if you're facing downhill) then turns into the gully with some switchbacks into the trees.  Enter the trees and descend for a bit along the edge of the gully, then descent the open part of the talus-filled gully to the nice paved path that runs behind the stables.

Of note, I did the first rappel with a 100m, and the  rope just barley made it to the second rap station. There is an intermediate set of bolts that look pretty shoddy, but you could try them lol (I wouldnt)    That quasi-2nd rappel station currently sits where the waterfall widens out, so expect to occasionally get showered on especially when the wind picks up- and be assured, even though its summer the water is brisk.   For the 2nd pitch of the rappel, I hung right, and be careful because there is big swing potential and its easy to slip. There is a piton and another quasi intermediate rap station on this pitch with slings in them that you can clip when you pass to keep from swinging all the way left into the waterfall.  The intermediate rap station sits on a mildly left sloping ledge, so if you do swing you should be able to work your way back right where you'll then be mostly lined up with the intermediate rap station. So, if you clip the aforementioned piton sling and rap station the swing potential should be mitigated after that point.    Another thing of note, the 2nd rappel was done with a full 60m and a tag line, with just a few meters to spare. So while the 100m was sufficient for the first rap, it might not be enough for the 2nd rappel.    Finally, there's enough water at the bottom that you will get submerged. Maybe not completely, but unless you're freakishly tall then expect to get torso deep in water at minimum. Be prepared to swim immediately right if you're facing the wall or straight left if you're facing away from the wall into the narrowing corridor rather than towards the pool that opens up to the other side   This rappel IS really cool but wanted to let anyone considering it to be prepared for wet conditions. I did it once at night and a couple times during the day; when its sunny, I think its quite enjoyable but if its cloudy or windy it's going to be a cold time. Best to be prepared accordingly in rain gear and such   I'm sure when water flow is lower it can be a lot more enjoyable. It was still fun but conditions, IMO, at the moment are not ideal.    So, tl;dr. Expect to get wet, expect to swim rn, you'll need two lines 60m or a tag line.   Oh, also, since the ropes are wet they're proper hard to pull. Make sure your ducks are in a row in terms of set up and direction of pull. Also needed a few people to pull it anyway, so keep your party on hand not just one person to help pull the ropes.

Semi-hanging belay/anchor station (top of ~67m first pitch) had a small convenient foot ledge and was created with 2 nuts and a cam (double sliding x).  The top of our second pitch easily reached the double bolt rap anchors.  For most, I would not consider this route to be a good beginner's easy trad lead due to run-outs, including a section before the top - which can be minimized by heading for easier ground to the left and bring doubles of pro for the crack.  The grade felt accurate.   Rappel:  Rappelled down in four pitches using a single 70m rope.  As mentioned, the first rap brings you just above anchors of The Grack, Marginal but within reach.  The next station is almost directly below.  The last station was a rap ring on slings around a tree.

A few notes:  - It's difficult to protect the traverse to the P1 ledge (hard left into the corner at the 3rd tree as others have mentioned) for the follower. It's really easy climbing following a wide horizontal crack hand over hand, but a follower fall would result in a pretty nasty swing into the corner.  - I thought the moves under/exiting the roof were the clear crux, and maybe hard for 5.6? I think I would have been pretty nervous if I was a 5.8 or below leader  - I didn't think the route was that dirty, some loose dirt on a few holds at the top was all. I've climbed wayyy dirtier (but still highly rated) routes in the valley.   - I looked all over and didn't find a bolted anchor at the top as indicated in the Sloan topo. Or even evidence of a chopped anchor (???). I slung the tree with a bight of my rope and extended myself and the belay back to the edge so I could see my follower.

The route is straightforward, scenic but not too exposed, and takes good gear.    The above beta is all accurate. First 15-20 feet are the hardest, and slowly eases off over the course of the climb. I was intimidated by some of the descriptions of Pitch 3 but it was actually probably the most mellow, comfortable climbing of the entire route - great feet the whole way up. Additionally, I agree with the above comment that distances seem overestimated. I did not measure myself but I don't think the actual climbing (as opposed to walking) part of P3 is any longer than 35'.    Traffic and wind noise from the road nearby can make hearing your partner a little difficult. When I walked from the P2 belay up to the begin of the actual 5th class part of P3, I built an anchor there and had my partner come up and belay me from that spot. It allowed better communication and also reduced sideways rope pull if I were to fall. Quite honestly you could probably belay from that spot even without an anchor as the ledge is still quite large. There are thick manzanita bushes, boulders, and of course the crack itself which all support good anchoring if necessary.   There is some webbing with a rap ring off to the right of the top of P3. We walked off WEST. Was relatively easy to find the climber's trail. Go back and slightly left from the top of P3 and you can't miss it. No significantly dangerous parts of the walk-off so I recommend choosing that over rapping.  ","Portland, OR",Yosemite Valley,105889783,5.6,beginner,"Sep 19, 2017"

What an amazing day.  A trip report:   - We left our car at the Glacier Apron lot at 7:45 and hiked directly from there.  The SuperTopo suggests taking the bus to the Happy Isles, but saving the .5 miles hiking didn't seem worth that effort.   - In addition to the light rack recommended above, we brought a sandwich and two energy bars each, plus 2.5 liters of water per person on a moderate/warm April day.  In retrospect, the food was more-or-less sufficient but the water was lean.  You may want to bring purification tablets so you can use the stream/snowmelt (if available) for water refill sources as opposed to lugging more water weight.   - Although the SuperTopo approach beta suggested taking the:  Muir Trail > Mist Trail > Muir Trail  we accidentally missed the Mist Trail turn-off and wound up hiking to Clark Point before heading a bit back down across the valley.  In retrospect, this didn't add much time and allowed us to avoid the oft-slippery Mist Trail portion as we stayed on well-groomed dry switchbacks all the way to Clark Point.  Not a bad alternative.   - After getting to the shoulder of Liberty Cap, the beta is to basically hug that rock as you head left, keeping tabs on a faint trail.  Soon you'll reach the gap between Liberty and Half Dome, where you'll turn right to traverse the gap before the terrain will turn more flat (a small stream will be on your left).  The trail then becomes fainter again, and the terrain more wooded.  At this point, we crossed the stream at an arbitrary point and found the start of the extensive cairns leading to the base.   - The toughest part of the approach felt like the last bit of hiking straight up steep, loose faint switchbacks in the heat of the morning, then traversing the Half Dome base to the route start.  Take your time in this section so you're not too burned out for the route itself.   - It took us a while to ID the route start from the SuperTopo because the cairns actually pass the Snake Dike route and go a little further to the base of a different route (I believe this is the ""SW Face"" route).  The key to finding Snake Dike is IDing the ""three trees"" in the topo that bracket the route from below.   - Lead this route only if you feel super-solid leading 5.8.  I think if you lead at a lower level, the extensive run-outs might feel pretty scary (though the climbing itself is very solid, especially after P2).   - Once on top of Half Dome, don't miss the epic photos from the top.  Recommendation is to (carefully) position one photographer on the ""diving board"" and the other(s) across the top for great views!   - I highly recommend prusiking into the Half Dome cables on the descent, especially if the cables are down.  That bit is pretty steep and you'll likely be pretty tired by that point, so better safe than sorry.   - We went for the one-day approach and although it was an exhausting day (took us 11 hours, 55 minutes car-to-car with minimal rests), I think this is the best way to do it as long as it's not too hot out.  We did see a couple parties during our decent hiking up to camp out at the base and do it in two days, but the prospect of carrying camping gear and more food/water up and down that approach did not sound fun.

This is the way to do it!  We had the summit to ourselves and only one other party. Very surreal at sunset.    Anyway, before we went for it, I asked around Yosemite (mountain shop and ranger station) and very quickly shopped the internet about the beta when the cables were down, and pretty much got nothing solid.  In my mind for some reason, I was envisioning the cables being just one long continuous cable system, anchored only at the bottom and the top.  In hindsight, this is quite a retarded assumption.   Obviously one long continuous cable is not the case.  There are giant intermediate eye bolts every so often, with smaller cables connecting these points to the main cable, as well as a few junctions of separate cables.  Despite these facts, when I was asking how to descend these safely at the mountain shop and got, ""uh, I mean people definitely do it..."" and not much of any other relevant info, to which I probed, ""...so do people just use a Prusik?""  To which he said, ""...ya.""  The ranger station was less help, providing the same, ""people do it..."" along with a disclaimer that the parks service didn't recommend it.   I was taking my girlfriend up this route, and the cables, with the knowledge they would be down, scared the shit out of her. My only option was to find the absolute safest way down these things, or I would not be sending.  I thought Prusik was my answer...   When we arrived at the cables, due to the dome shape, I could only see about 30 feet of cable.  So we set up Prusik's along with a PAS locked onto the cable, for some redundancy.  We began the descent and quickly ran into a cable support described above, so we were forced to untie the prusik and retie it on the other side of the support.  Then 20 feet later it happened again. And again.... I could see this was becoming a continuous theme, and finally decided this prusik system would literally take hours and could not continue.   The giant eye-bolts were pretty frequent, and provided a perfect rap anchor.  We had a single 60m, and only in one spot was it not long enough to rap to the next eye-bolt, to which we then employed the prusik system I originally devised and slid down to the next eye-bolt and continued our rap.  If you had double ropes, you could very easily make it in 3-4 raps, with no prusik shenanigans.   So, these are the scenarios I can see in order from quickest to slowest (and sketchiest to safest) for descending the cables when they are down for the season:   Just go hand over hand on the cables, solo, no pro. A guy in another party did this in front of us and descended them in ~5 minutes. X rated.Go hand over hand on the cables, but clipped into the cable Via Ferrata style. R rated.  If I did this again, (not with my girlfriend or other equally weary 2nd), this would absolutely be the way to go. You could still take a nasty R rated fall, but being clipped into the cables, you would be stopped at the next junction. Descending in this way would almost be as fast as doing it solo.  Via Ferrata would ensure you would always remain clipped in while changing over at cable junctions/supports.  The cables route is very slick from the 1 million+ ascents of tourists, so as mentioned above, better to walk on the outside of whichever cable you choose to clip into.Rappel the cables. G Rated.  As mentioned above, there are giant eye-bolt supports all over this thing, which makes rappelling a very doable scenario, even with a single rope.  Double ropes would make quick work of it, and with a single rope there is one section (unfortunately the steepest part) where your rope doesn't get you to the next eye-bolt.  Be sure you've tied knots at the end of your rope, and when you reach this point, Prusik into the cable, preferably backing it up with some form of PAS (personal anchor system).  Hand-over-hand down the cable until you get to the next eye-bolt, then pull your rope and continue the series of raps.  This took us awhile, as rapping does, but it was an absolutely solid way to descend these with very little sketchiness.  For anyone taking someone up Snake Dike that is not willing to risk any form of fall, this is the way to go.   Hope this helps a few people out.

Within the space of about 30 minutes, four groups arrived just behind ours.  A 5am start from Curry Village would be ideal.  - Water can definitely be an issue.  If you bring a filter, water's available about halfway up at Little Yosemite.  If not, there's fresh water at Vernal Falls footbridge, a little less than a mile into the hike.  You'd definitely want to top off there.  - On pitch 1, there's a 5.9 undercling immediately below the roof (see the many YouTube videos), or an easier 5.7 traverse 10-15 feet below.  If you look on the videos, you'll see a clear border of different colored rock - the lower part has much better grip.  - As for the cables, do remember to bring grippy gloves, and my two cents is that it's easiest to climb down backwards.  In addition to letting you grip with the balls of your feet rather than heels, and allowing your arms to stay locked, you get a clear view of the person above you.  Based on my one experience, perhaps the greatest danger on the entire route is one of the overly-tired hikers plowing into you from above - you'd at least see them climbing backwards.  - For what it's worth, we felt the hike to the base, after leaving the main trail, was one of the nicest in all Yosemite.

Our rack was a set of nuts, one pink tricam, and a handful of alpine draws (single length and triple length). Left camp at 6am, at the base by 10am, at the summit by 1pm, back by 5pm.   On Crowds:  Even early in the season (and early in the morning), there was a party of three at the base in front of us, and a party not far behind. Luckily, the party of three let us go ahead; by the time we lost sight of them (on the 6th pitch) they were still at the third. An efficient and confident party could easily summit in two hours, but in my opinion, climbers should plan for 4 hours on route.   On Gear:  Our light rack proved perfect. It was nice and light for the long approach, yet I was able to comfortably protect the friction traverse on the first pitch as well as build decent anchors on the 7th and 8th.   On Descending:  The cables were still down for the season, but the descent was pretty painless. We wore gloves and tied prussiks around the cables to descend. We had to re-tie the prussiks multiple times to get around points where the cables were fixed (and to avoid ascending hikers), but still managed to get down the cables in roughly 15 minutes.   On the Experience:  In all, this climb was fantastic and well worth the grueling approach. It would not be a wise choice for a 5.7 climber, but 5.8  climbers will likely enjoy it, and more experienced climbers should not discount it. If you are a climber who has never summitted Half Dome, do yourself a favor: take a day and climb Snake Dike.   ","Salt Lake City, UT",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Apr 18, 2016"

About 8 alpine slings.      What I wish we brought:    A light weight water pump.  You will want to go as light as you can on the route, but when you are coming down, you'll want water and there won't be any for about 8 miles.  Solution: bring a light weight water pump and pump at the river about 1/2 down the descent.       Approach:  Maybe the crux of the climb.  Get to Happy Isles.  We had to park in Half Dome Village Parking lot (formerly known as Curry Village).  Get on the John Muir trail and hike up forever.  You'll pass two waterfalls (Nevada and Vernal, but maybe not in that order).  This part of the trail is very steep.     Once you get past the second waterfall, the trail will level out.  Liberty Cap will be on your left.  Apparently there is an approach that goes towards Liberty Cap, but we didn't take it.  Keep hiking until Liberty Cap tapers off. There will be a climbers trail on your left, and it's not terribly hard to miss.    GPS coordinates for the climbers trail: N 37.73160, W 119.52110.     Follow the climbers trail for a long while.  You'll pass Lost Lake on your right.  Eventually the trail will lead you into a shrubby talus scramble.  We followed cairns all the way to the base of the route.  It tends leftward and is pretty long.  Here are GPS coordinates for the start of the climb: N 37.73980, W 119.54020.    The Climb:   There's plenty of beta on this already, so I'll just say this: the climbing was less secure and much more scary than I expected.  Though it's easy, portions of the Dike are somewhat slippery, and there aren't really any good, solid holds until the very end.    There was one section of the climb where I ran my 70 M rope all the way out and only clipped two pieces, so I'm going to give this an X.   Also, on P3, if you fall on the 5.7 friction traverse before getting to the bolt, you will totally land on your belayer.  Follow the 1000 ft or so of calf burning 3rd class to the summit.  This is probably the crux of the climb and we had to rest maybe 4-8 times while doing it.     The Descent:   Take the Half Dome cables down.  We followed the advice of others and just clipped our PAS into the cables and walked around the outside, cutting the huge lines and traffic jam.  This upset some people in line and was very scary for my partner, but I would do it again in a heart beat.    Follow the trail back down to wherever you parked your car.  Use the water pump at the river along the way or this hike is going to suck.  This is why some people call the route Snake Hike.  It's not because the climbing is easy, it's because you hike about 18 mi in a day.    ","Salt Lake City, UT",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Sep 14, 2016"

I'd been climbing for less than a year and had lead maybe 10 pitches of trad before this, but all similar rock (Lovers leap, Tahquitz, etc) and all multi-pitch, we both had a fair bit of experience with belay transitions etc.   P1 we put a cam in at the roof on the right side, downclimbed to the non-polished rock then traversed over. My partner got a micro-cam in on the upward crack but it popped out, then got another good piece in higher up and then proceeded to the bolted anchors. The cam popping out was actually helpful for me seconding, since I didn't have a pendulum potential once I got the roof piece out.   For my lead I started the traverse left towards the dike too early and didn't go high enough. By the time I saw the traverse bolt, I was way below it, so I just kept traversing until I got onto the dike. Really scary given that if I blew it, I would have fallen straight onto my belayer and then pendulumed. Once onto the dike it was a lot easier, but I ended up being so in the zone that I missed the anchors on the left and going all the way to the single bolt and then finishing at the anchors on the right, barely having enough rope with a 70M. That was a lot better for my second, though.    Above P3 it was easy. As the person above said, the dike holds are generally not very positive, but I found it not scary at all if you go one move at a time and make sure your feet are good. Definitely recommend a 70M and linking pitches, just make sure to use the topo and do the math.    On the hike, we started at 4AM from Happy Isles and were at the base of the route at 7:15, first on the route. We reached the summit at 11 and were back down in the valley by 3.  I recommend a similar strategy, hiking up the mist trail in the dark was easy and pleasant and the sun was just coming up when we had to go onto the climbers trail and the route-finding started.

Me and my partner are also fairly conservative when it comes to gear, so we brought doubles for the route but this truly can be done with a good attitude, 2 quick draws, 4 slings, and singles from .2 - 1. Just take what you need. Once you step off from the trailhead, follow the Mist Trail all the way until you reach the wooden bridge just after Vernal Falls. We brought a water filter and filtered 6 liters of water each just upstream from the bridge prior to going any further because were unsure about any other water sources up ahead and we still had a ways to go in 90+ degree heat. However, there was a small stream another 30 minutes up. After crossing the bridge, follow the hiker's trail up until you can literally touch Liberty Cap. At this point, the hiker's trail veers right and a climber's trail veers left--this is your left turn. Follow this trail, skirting the side of Liberty Cap and social trails until it takes you up between Mt. Broderick and Liberty Cap. At this point the trail becomes a little lost with brush and talus, so you just have to pick the best route through. Once you get past the two formations, you should see Half Dome to your left at which point you should start heading up until you see an open meadow. This meadow is Lost Lake and several cairns can be seen to your immediate left. At this point there is no obvious trailhead and you may be lulled into going right. Instead, go left skirting the left side of the open meadow and a well-traveled trail will present itself. If you find yourself bush wacking at any point from here on out you are off track. Follow the climbers trail up until you reach another junction with two cairns marking trails going both left and right, either way takes you up but right is more direct. The next junction you arrive to is where these two trails meet. So, if you opted to go right, do not go left at the second junction as this will just take you back down hill. Go up and right up what appears to be a scary slab. Once you take this trail, the cairns mark the way through the slabs avoiding any scary committing moves. Everything felt pretty solid and at no point did I feel like I was doing any actual climbing.   The climb -- Apparently, there is an alternate start to this route however my partner opted for the regular start and ended up climbing into the undercling to place protection. From there he traversed hard left, staying true to the undercling which afforded him adequate protection but felt a bit harder than 5.7. As someone who hates slab, I can honestly say that everything else after this pitch felt really easy in comparison and was waiting for several more ""5.7 cruxes"" that just never came. Once you get past pitch 1 everything is cruiser and just a mental game of staying calm high above your protection. At the top of pitch 2, you will see a right leaning dike with a bolt 15 ft up--this is a 10a route. Pitch 3 goes left here! From here, just follow the route beta and you should be just fine.   The descent -- Head down the cables and follow the Half-Dome hiker's trail back towards Liberty Cap for 8 knee-pounding miles. This trail will not be the same trail that you took on the approach in, but it will eventually meet back up at the same Liberty Cap junction where the climber trail splits left.

It was a little light on gear for the top two gear pitches - with a 2-piece anchor at the top and bottom of each pitch, that left only 2 pieces of pro for the pitch itself, but it still worked okay. If I did it again I might bring a .3 cam as well.   We also each brought a pair of gloves for descending the cables, which was excellent beta - it would have been much colder and more painful without them.   On P1, I led up to the right side of the ""roof"" by scrambling up the slab, put a piece in (on very long extended slings), and then downclimbed a ways before traversing left and back up to the roof. This avoided a very slick friction traverse / lieback in the thin seam in the roof. It also meant I did the traverse mostly on toprope, which was nice.

I always come to MP to read the comments before I head to places and generally get good information but I feel like many of the comments below are misleading.  First off, the route was fantastic!  I loved every bit of it and the description as far as the climbing goes was spot on.  More than a few times in the past people have asked about doing the trip as an over-nighter and almost everyone votes against it, saying that Little Yosemite is WAY out of the way (some people even posted it was an hour out of the way) and that you have to carry way too much gear if you're camping.  My wife and I were trying to take it fairly easy while out in Yosemite (she's in the early stages of pregnancy and super tired all the time) so we opted for an over-nighter despite what I read below.  There are two options for this:  the snake dike bivy or Little Yosemite Valley.  The Snake Dike Bivy isn't talked about much and you can't get it ahead of time, only walk up, but the rangers said its always available because not many people know about it.  This was basically created because climbers were getting LYV permits and then camping up near the base of the route.  You have to carry bear canisters to camp there.  We chose LYV so we didn't have to carry a bear canister.  The campground for backpackers is AT MOST a 15 minute walk past the climbers trail for Snake Dike.  We literally walked from the top of Nevada Falls to camp in 20 minutes.  We left the valley floor around lunchtime and cruised slow up to camp and still had plenty of time to swim, filter water, chill out, and cook dinner before dark.  We woke up at 5:30 am, left camp by 6 with one small pack wearing our harnesses, and were first on the route by 8, with no one else showing up until 8:30.  It was super relaxed.  After climbing the route we walked back to camp and then down to the valley floor for pizza and beer.  On the way down we passed two other groups that had climbed Snake Dike behind us that were miserable and said they were over the hike and wish they wouldn't have tried it in a day.  So I say all of that just to say, if you are thinking about doing it as a two day trip GO FOR IT.  It is definitely a valid option for people that are slower.  Can it be done in one day?  Most definitely.  Probably even quite easily for many people, but that doesn't mean it isn't still an enjoyable experience doing it other ways.     A few other notes that I think are helpful.     After leaving Lost Lake we followed the trail to top of the hill where a few different approach trails split.  Everyone pretty much told us to head straight for the base of Half Dome from here and then traverse the slabs.  This definitely seems like the best way to do it.  The trail up the gully as well as the traverse on the slabs has been (somewhat) recently wrecked by a big rock slide.  It's a little ominous walking up through the splintered trees and gruss and dust covering everything, but it does make the bushwhacking quite easy and the path is fairly open.  The rocks are still super unstable and haven't settled yet so be careful here.   The bolts on the first couple of pitches are definitely bomber and have little ASCA tags on many of them with a date when they were replaced, but the upper pitches (both protection and anchors) have spinners and bolts that have backed out a bit on every single one.  They are not confidence inspiring.  The climbing is easy so I guess there's not much to worry about, but the comments and descriptions would have you believe that the bolts that are there are all bomber and newer.       Those are the few things that surprised me the most so I just wanted to mention them in case they are helpful to others.  Definitely not any reason to not do the route.  It is an amazing feature on Half Dome and such a cool summit.  I'll definitely do it again!  ","Little Rock, Arkansas",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"May 15, 2018"

Here are my thoughts:   Approach: Daniel Evans describes it well in his comment.  We took the mist trail and went between Liberty Cap and Mt. Broderick.  Approach took us about 3- 3.5 hrs, with my partner having come from 3ft below sea level in New Orleans.  If you do any type of hiking/ backpacking in the mountains, the approach is not that big a deal (though I am still feeling the 1000 ft of slabs in my calves.)   Gear:  .4- #1 Camalot, doubles in .5 and .75, 6 alpine draws, two cordalette anchors.  If you want more than a 2 piece anchor at the top of the last 2 pitches you will want doubles in those sizes.  Carried a selection of nuts, never placed any.   Route: We did the alternate start for pitch one, climbing the left side by the tree.  This was mellow and I would recommend it.  5.7 slab traverse on pitch 3 was very polished.  The belay at the top of the 3rd pitch is inaccurately represented on both the Supertopo and in the Sloan Guide.  There is not a belay station on left side of the dike, rather 2 bolts (one bomber, one crappy) one either side of the dike.  To utilizes these you will need a cord or an anchor longer than a standard double length sling.  I skipped this anchor looking for the actual station and ended up climbing to the next one.  This may require 5-6ft of simul-climbing with a 60m rope, depending on if you slung the new bolt above the pitch 2 belay or not.   Fixed gear: Above pitch 2, the bolts are garbage.  They appear to be 3/4 inch bolts, some heavily corroded, all with old SMC hangers.  Pretty much all the of the hangers were spinners and not flush with the wall.  You are already climbing a route with 80ft runouts- its a bummer to finish a pitch of that and then have to do a semi-hanging belay on shitty bolts.  The safety of the mid pitches is just a step above soloing.  If you are on this route you should already be climbing with a no fall mentality, but it is also not comforting to belay off those things, especially if you have multiple parties at a belay.  I understand that its a logistical pain in the ass to replace bolts on this route.  I encourage anyone who climbs in Yosemite to donate to the ASCA.    3rd class to summit: calf busters for sure.  We simul-climbed another 300ft or so with some gear just to make sure that we were out of anything overly exposed.  Approach shoes made this feel very comfortable.  After that, we coiled the rope and trudged.  It was tiring but didn't take that long.     Descent (with the cables down): We clipped in PAS's to the cables and just hand over hand climbed down- This was not a big deal with a harness and approach shoes. As has been noted, you would still get hurt in a fall with this method, but it does prevent a catastrophic fall.  The weight of the cables helps to plant your feet firmly flush to the wall.  We descended casually in under 10 minutes.  You could attach a prussik to the cables, as we only did about 4 change-overs, so that is not out of the question if you are worried about the descent.  Rappelling seems like it would take the longest and possibly wreck your rope, as it would be pulled over the cables at some point.   Water: Drank 1 liter on approach, and we both climbed with 2 each.  This allowed us to be hydrated enough to enjoy our lunches on the summit.  We filtered water after about 3.5 miles of the descent.   Summary: hardwear needs and upgrade, don't fall, and if ya'll are struggling on the approach or descent- get some sticky rubber shoes and do more cardio.  It is also hard for me to believe that people think the cables or the slabs are the scariest parts, in comparison to the climbing huge runouts with bolt hangers that would most certainly fail in a factor 2 fall- the other aspects are quite tame.

Both start out on the Muir trail to the Mist Trail. After you pass vernal, you'll eventually come face to face with liberty cap. This is where they split:    1. Contour left around liberty cap, into the gully. This is apparently pretty straightforward, as you are in a gully with steep walls on either side. You basically just need to keep going until you can escape to the left (Northish) which would putyou near lost lake. Though we did not use this beta, the people we talked to said it was very easy.    2. Contour right along liberty cap, following the mist trail to the muir trail again, then up that. The trail will flatten, and after a while, you will see a very obvious climbers trail on the left with a very spiky cairn as of Nov 3, 2018. This trail will put you near lost lake as well, and from there:    Both approach beta's now aim more or less for the south of half dome, and follow large cairns. The 3rd class slabs are exposed in some places, but very secure. Clear evidence of a large-ish rockfall here, so be aware.    We chose the left (alternate) start and it is mellow friction on bullet granite to the roof. You can sling the tree easily, and this whole pitch takes about 5 minutes for the leader.    The ""missing"" third pitch anchor mentioned so many times is actually still there- it is just below you when you finish the friction traverse on pitch 3. As you cross over to the larger of the 2 branches of the true snake dike, look down. It is right there, with a red sling. However, it would be pretty insane to clip this and keep climbing. Once you hit the dike, you are in jug city, just run it out. The Two bolts that are ""too far apart"" straddling the dike are in fine condition, just use a long sling to extend the anchor to a reasonable angle.    The run outs on this climb start in earnest above this point (end of 3) but the climbing is ridiculously secure. Without exaggerating too much, the most likely way for you to fall at this point would be if you turned around and leapt off.    The slabs on top are really nothing to be worried about, except that they take forever and are cardio hell. They are low enough angle that you can just walk up them... there is no route finding involved, and comments otherwise are very confusing... you just keep going up. Not really sure how you can mess that up. I think most people start this part up near the huge broken tectonic-plate like formations at the top of pitch 8.

When at the anchors, you will see a bolt-line to your 11 o'clock. THIS IS NOT THE ROUTE. This, after checking local guidebooks, is a 5.10 climb. Climb directly to climber's left, straight to the dike. There is a single bolt to protect the traverse (you may not see it from the anchors, but it is there).

Everything else is cake after only 8ft of traversing.   Also, I highly suggest skipping the first bolt on the dike after the P3 traverse (w/ the tat masterpoint), and instead climbing 30-40ft up to the next bolt, this significantly mitigates swing potential for your follower and reduces a ton of rope drag.

After doing both starting variations to p1, I agree that skipping the right-hand start with the traverse beneath the rooflet skips a crux and detracts from what the route has to offer. But, it does seem to make sense from a speed and rope-direction perspective to just go directly up the slab from the left.   I was skeptical, but a friction hitch on the cables using a Dyneema/Spectra sling DOES work. I used a simple autoblock knot with 5 wraps and guided it along with the bottom hand to smoothly move down, sliding hands along the cable as normal with fall protection that catches quickly (cable standards were down, this would be much slower and unnecessary when the cable standards are up).   Advantages to cable standards being down: 1) you can pull the cable off to the side and be out of the slick on better friction 2) no crowds   Thumbs up to the water filter idea  ",,Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Apr 21, 2021"

Climbing was not hard but the 5.7 traverse at start of p3 to get to the dike and the endless slabs at the top sketched me out. Everything took us longer than expected. Thought 3.5 hours for approach; used 4.5 hours (went up JMT instead of Mist Trail, adding 1.2mi). Expected 2 parties ahead of us at start, actually waited 2 hours for 5 parties ahead of us to start. Hoped for 30 minutes/pitch but actually used 45 min/pitch (slow anchor building and belay changovers). Thought we'd do the ""endless slabs"" in 45 minutes but we were so tired and unacclimated to 8000'+ altitude that took us 2 hours from finishing p8 to reaching the very top (we kept stopping on the slabs to sit down and rest).    Other thoughts:   1) Had water filter but didn't refill at Merced river--a mistake. Started p1 with 1.7L for me and 1.5L for Eric and both and ran out on top, had to hike down thirsty for 3 miles. Given the weather (55-70F, sometimes windy) we should have started p1 with 2.3L for me and 2L for my partner (I sweat more).   2) LYV has a nice outhouse building (bathrooms on 2nd floor) and supposedly a water tap at the Ranger station, which we never found, so after wandering around a bit we went across the campground to filter river water.    3) If you've never hiked the HD trail, it's unmarked from bottom of the cables until half-way down subdome. From cables, hike NE straight over top of subdome then ENE down gentle slabs until you find the stone steps leading to switchbacks. When you hit junction of HD trai and JMT trail, turn right for Yosemite Valley.  4) We brought too much gear: 15 draws (only needed 6 alpine and 1 regular), 11 nuts and 3 tricams (didn't place except while fooling around on p1 roof start), 2 nut tools, 2 belay knives, 4 prusiks (only needed 2 prusiks), 3 anchor setups (only needed 2), 1 pair crack gloves, 3 extra sets of AAA batteries for the headlamps (only needed 2 extra sets), 4oz bug spray (only saw 1 mosquito), 3oz sunscreen (should have applied and left it in the car), 6 slings (only needed 2), 6 extra wiregates (only needed 2), 4 snack/protein bars for (3 would have been enough), etc.   5) After the optional belay station on p3, bailing would be difficult with just one rope, plus many anchors above the start of p4 don't have quicklinks or rap rings. The two parties ahead of us bailed, one from p3 using 2 ropes and the other from top of p1 with one rope (they downclimbed after rappeled to the end of their rope).    If I did it again, I would bring less gear and train a lot more beforehand on the uphill hiking--we underestimated the hiking and it kicked our butts.  I'd top off my water above Nevada Falls, where the trail sign says ""Last Water.) We should have taken the Mist trail uphill (shorter) and the JMT trail through Clark Point on the return (longer but less steep. That would have let us avoid descending hundreds (thousands?) of steps and getting sprayed by Vernal Fall at night (better to be sprayed in the morning while hiking uphill). And I would skip the prusik when descending the cables and just use 2 tethers plus gloves, especially if the cables were up. We had to wrap and unwrap our prusiks at least 6 times going down the cables even though only 2 support poles were up.  ","San Jose, CA",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"May 26, 2021"

I did read through just about every comment here before the climb. For context, I am mostly a boulderer (V6/7ish) but very new to trad/multipitch. This was my 4th climb in Yosemite, so definitely somewhat inexperienced on this style and granite. I felt like some of the comments were totally different from my experience:   The weather:  We did it mid September, it was 85-90 degrees on the valley floor and around 70 degrees at the base of the climb. We started at 6am so we got to do a lot of the approach without direct sun. Hottest part was easily from the climbers junction up to the base of the climb, the exposed slabs were an absolute oven. I guess that's what we get for doing it in the late summer season. We had a great breeze all day which kept things cool and dry. Even though we did this on a Sunday we didn't see a single other person between the climbers trail junction and the peak. It was pretty special to have the entire wall to ourselves the full day.   The Hike/Water:  We knew it was going to suck since I am out of hiking shape and it very much did. I could see it being less of a suffer fest if you trained for it. Overall we spent about 10 hours hiking which was a bit more than expected, but again we didn't really prepare much. We brought minimal water up to the mist trail and filtered at the top of Nevada falls, meaning we never had to carry much water weight. However I drink a ton of water so I somehow managed to get through all 4 liters from the top of Nevada falls to the top of half dome (lol). We refilled at Nevada again on the way down, but went about 4 miles without water. I switched from hiking shoes to approach shoes and stashed my poles/filter/shoes at the junction with the climbers trail, it was a nice way to carry less weight and mix up the type of strain on the legs. Overall I'd recommend being in good hiking shape before attempting or you will suffer.   Gear:  We brought doubles of everything below #1 and 1 #1 cam. There's actually a lot of gear placements on the upper pitches which apparently nobody mentioned (every 20-30 feet or so) and we liked having the extra gear. I was a bit confused on the recommended rack, since both pitch 7 and pitch 8 need gear anchors, which would leave essentially no pro for the pitches. For pitch 8 I placed 4 pieces and barely had enough for an anchor, but hey maybe I just don't like running it out that much. I personally felt the extra gear was easily worth it...cams don't weigh that much. we brought 4 alpine draws and 2 normal draws, we wished we had 6 alpine and 2 normal. Make sure you bring gloves for the cables.   The Climb:  This took somewhere between 5-5.5 hours. We did the alternate tree start. Comments on here led us to believe it would be a walk in the park from the slung tree to the roof (a #1 was very solid pro here), but in our opinion this was easily the crux of the climb and was basically a guaranteed ground fall. For context, we found the 'crux' slab traverse on pitch 3 felt very easy, but for some reason this first runout from the tree just seemed a lot trickier and heady with the ground fall. I do think it was more about headspace than climbing difficulty, but still felt like the most challenging climbing of the route.   The climbing is easy, but a bit more tenuous than I was hoping (again, not super experienced with granite). Lots of options, but most of the dike is semi-slippery dishes. Just take your time to find the best feet and it will feel pretty good. I led pitch 2 (very fun), pitch 4 (the 70 foot runout was a bit WTF, essentially soloing at that point in my opinion), pitch 6 (I slung 3 mediocre knobs, the climbing was basically 5.2 at this point), and pitch 8 (really fun climbing, surprisingly). I didn't think I would fall, but I am a bit conservative with pro so it was more of a headspace battle. I'm super happy to have done it though, just make sure your head game is good before attempting or you might need to bail.    We expected pitch 7 and 8 to be trivial based on comments, but thought they were a good bit harder than the dike pitches. May have been slightly off route on these last two looking at the topo lines, I felt like they were both 5.6ish. Overall none of the climbing felt 5.7 to me, but a lot of the things labelled 5.4 or 5.3 in the topo did feel harder. Overall my thoughts on the grades:   P1: 5.6 R  P2: 5.3 R  P3: 5.5 R  P4: 5.4 X  P5: 5.5 R  P6: 5.2 R  P7: 5.5 R  P8: 5.6   If you have a similar experience/background to me this may be helpful in choosing which pitches to lead and which to follow.   The topout:  These took us a bit under 1.5 hours. The slabs after the climb were way sketchier than I expected. In many spots here you would almost certainly die if you slipped, since there isn't much to self-arrest on. Slipping is super unlikely due to the ease of the terrain, but the fact that it is was steeper than 45 degrees for the majority was spooky to me. We simulclimbed from the end of the 8th pitch to the top. it was barely slower than just walking unroped and there was plenty of pro every 50 feet or so. To be honest we needed the breaks anyways since it's at a pretty high elevation, it was much harder on the cardio for this section.  Again, falling is unlikely (you could literally jog up it safely if you were fit enough), but I just didn't feel comfortable climbing something like that without a rope. I think just do what makes you feel safe here.   The cables:  The cables were up when we did it, but I still find them sketchy. I can't believe so many hikers do this, the rock is absolutely polished! Maybe ignorance is bliss or maybe I should go down facing backwards so I can't see what's ahead haha.   Overall impression:  It was a tough, long day and I wish the bolts were in better condition since they are all quite loose (even the anchors) for those runouts. However, the experience was amazing and I loved it.  ",,Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Sep 14, 2021"

One party at the top of 1st pitch when we arrived, another party arrived when we were at top of 4th. Summited half dome around 4-4:30, it was a ghost town, very cool considering how crowded the top can get! Not sure if due to the current Yosemite day pass lottery system/covid capacity requirements in the park, or if it was just late enough in the afternoon for most hikers to have already headed home, but it was awesome.    I attempted this climb in 2018 and didn't finish -- I read all comments on this page before that attempt, and my only note i'll say about that attempt is MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BAIL PLAN. My sister is my new partner and I had us haul a second rope this time around -- definitely led to extra fatigue/misery (especially when doing the Mist Trail on the way down), but worth it IMO so you don't get stuck having to call YOSAR if shit unexpectedly hits the fan a 6 mile hike up from the valley (we decided extra sweat to haul the extra rope we already owned was worth it rather than buying a brand new extra-skinny bail rope, but you may disagree). I know people do this climb in the dark, but I especially cant imagine hiking up the slabs in the pitch black. Just something to consider, to each their own.   Gear: I brought a single BD .3/.4, double BD .5 thru 1s, 4-5 small-medium nuts, and felt like everything was used at least once.  4 alpines, 1 quad length alpine (useful for tree sling, and some upper pitch placements), 6 quickdraws (probably only used 4 max ever before regrouping, including for redirecting the belay). There's plenty of gear placements on pitch 7+8, not sure why you'd VOLUNTARILY make them R rated after finishing all the R rated pitches below :) Alex Pfiffner's comments right above about gear usage/gear anchors is spot on.   Pitch 4 is the headiest IMO despite the crux technically being a single traverse move on pitch 3 -- the dike just seems to keep going, your last bolt farther and farther away. After that, the pitches get progressively shorter, or ladder-like secure (pitch 6), or with chicken heads to sling (pitch 5) or just genuine gear placements (7+8).    Took 16.25 hours Curry Village to Curry Village -- started walking at 4:30 am, and got back at 8:45 just in time to order pizza and beer while we hobbled around on dead feet. Had to wait a couple times for the follower ahead of us to start up off the anchor, but never for a huge amount of time. My sister and I are in decent shape, albeit at sea level -- just know the day is LONG. We brought a super small water filter, and its 1000% worth it. The slabs are pretty brutal after the climb, we bear crawled in our climbing shoes probably the first 50% of the way up since losing our balance with heavy packs and tired legs seemed not completely out of the question. Didn't take climbing shoes off till we reached the cairns marking the summit. We both admitted later that the ""scariest"" part of the day for us was realizing if the other one slipped on this section, we wouldn't be able to help. Simple via-ferrata type strategy for cables down, no big deal.   Once we hit top of Nevada Falls on the hike down, the remaining 3-4 miles just seemed to stretch on forever. Mist trail magically added what felt like 500 extra steps since the morning we walked up them, and the lower pavement section stretched on for an extra eternity. But here I am, three days later, already thinking of every bit of the day super fondly :) its an awesome climb!! a great personal milestone for anyone, have fun  ","Seattle, WA",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Sep 22, 2021"

Exertion:   This was the most physically exhaustive day I've ever had. We were on the wall for almost 6 hours and the entire day was 18 hours. We started at 4:30am and got back to the car after 10pm.    Decent:   You absolutely need gloves to descend the cables.

But tl;dr you’ll be fine with a 60, and there’s no need to do a very short pitch to avoid running out of rope.   There are 2 things that look like they might be the p3 anchors:  1. A pair of new bolts, 10’ to the right of the dike on a tiny ledge. Overall, this seems like the better option for a p3 belay. But I am not sure whether a 50m rope would reach from here to p4, or easy it is to traverse those 10’ off the dike, 60’ above your last pro. Or maybe this is a belay for Eye in the Sky.  2. A new bolt on the left and an old buttonhead on the right of the dike, 4’ apart from each other, 10’ above option #1. The 2 bolts are far enough apart that we had to make a rope anchor to have enough material. It’s such a weird setup that I doubt it’s meant to be an anchor. It created more rope drag compared to option #1 because the dike curves rightward in p4.    Supertopo shows a 2-bolt anchor on the left of the dike on top of p3. But this either does not exist, or it represents the weird dike-straddling anchor.   We used option #2 and had ~40ft of rope left on a 60m at the end of p4. Option #1 would definitely work with a 60 as well, and probably with a 50.   I have made a corrected topo but can't upload it to MP due to copyright warnings.

There are not enough bolts. That being said, Tristan is right – if you can onsight solo a 5.4 then the odds are you will be totally fine on this route. But I would *absolutely* recommend doing your homework and intimately understanding the beta, the protection places (thanks N Kalli!), and the risks *before* you go. Anna fell because she went past some anchor bolts and then down climbed, and to me that is the true risk here. Don't miss the anchors, and don't go the wrong way (only really possible at the very start of pitch 3; remember to go LEFT, NOT up!!).   Anyway, here's a trip report:  • 3:30 AM wakeup at Upper Pines  • Carbo loaded, then hit the Mist Trail trailhead around 4:15 AM.  • Hiked by headlamp. The hike isn't too long, but the beginning especially was *exhausting*. You're looking at like 6 miles and 3000 feet of elevation gain, most of it front-loaded. But you're going up stairs, so it's not difficult other than cardio.  • Reached the base of the climb around 7:30 (3h15m total time). That was a solid pace but with plenty of resting – I'm not sure where the 5 hour estimates come from unless you have a picnic.  • There was nobody else there. Took the alternate start just before 8:00 AM and up we went. Other people showed up by the time we were on pitch 3, and that seemed to be the beginning of a conga line. So arrive before 8 if you want to be first. Sunrise was incredible and the weather was absolutely perfect.  • Finished the climb around 11:45 AM. Took longer than expected – we kept stopping to double check we were still on route, and even with doing that had some confusion at various points. Most notably, we accidentally went the wrong way on pitch 7, but by the time you get there it's basically choose your own adventure and our way was plenty doable. Had to simul for about 10 feet to reach a trad anchor point.  • Took a lunch break, then hit the slabs. OMG those slabs. I really did not enjoy it. They just seemed to go on forever. It took us about 90 minutes to hit the top. I was gassed by this point from low sleep and needed to take many rests.  • Hung out at the summit for awhile and then took the (dropped) cables down with a prussik and locking biner on a sling. I really would not bother with the prussik in hindsight. It's easy enough to hand-over-hand, and having to squat awkwardly to move the prussik along was super annoying and tiring. That being said, with only a biner on a sling, if you fell at just the wrong time you will tumble very far and there's a good chance your non-dynamic sling would snap from the force. So.... your choice.  • Hiked back. Got back by 4:30 PM. Gorged on pizza and beer.  • Overall length was about 12.5 hours.   I am quite an experienced trad climber, but I never really push grades that hard (more an adventure climber), and I found this climb extremely easy and fun. I'd say in the gym I project 5.12s, in Yosemite 5.9s. Compared to many other routes in the valley, I would even rate this something like a 5.5. The blank slab traverse crux at the start of pitch 3 was the single hardest part but it wasn't difficult – just need to move slowly and be careful with feet. Then pretty much the entire rest of the climb is just a ladder. But the run outs, oh my! They were a lot. As others said, I just had to climb like I was free soloing and not expect to place any pro. For that reason, I might even recommend folks free solo a few things (for example I solo'd Tenaya before this) to get the head game right.

To anyone who doesn't have much slab climbing experience and wants to jump on this route, I highly recommend setting aside a day or two before hand to go practice some true no handholds slab climbing and really start to learn the technique and what your shoes can actually handle. Based on all the comments I was expecting to find slick glacial polished slab with heady smearing. Instead I thought the rock was highly textured and super grippy, with all the slab climbing quite easy and secure. I didn't think there was any mandatory 5.7 moves on this route, especially not by older grading standards. I consider myself someone who gets scared easily in dangerous climbing situations and I never felt concerned while climbing on the dike, all very secure and a decent amount of pro during the short 5.5 section. I do highly recommend bringing a 70 meter rope unless you are confident in finding the belay stations and don't want to link pitches. I linked pitches 4/5 and 7/8 and thought that made for a much more enjoyable climb. Linking pitch 4/5 left me with about 10ft of rope and 7/8 took every inch. As strange as it sounds for such a direct route, I saw multiple people miss bolts/belays and wind up at alternate belays where they may have had to down climb with a shorter rope, guess its easy to not look around when you are so focused on the climbing in front of you.   I thought the topo on pitch 7/8 was a little confusing but the MP description is spot on. You want to head just a little right up the slab a short ways into the right facing flake, then when you get to the roof head left and find a good spot to pull over onto the slab that will take you up to a bunch of stacked blocks. Wished I had some bigger cams to belay here but was still able to make do with a couple .3's and a .4. Don't take the arching roof crack to the right at the top of pitch 7, I thought this was maybe the 5.2 fingers but it was a lot tougher than that and led to a crux down climb when I realized it went nowhere.    I thought the 3rd class hiking, while a workout, was very secure, no way you are gonna slip and tumble down the whole way. there are a couple fifth class moves getting over some ledges, so you may want to give less experienced climbers a spot or a hand getting over them.   We descended with the cables down, and I thought it was a really mellow and fun descent without using prusiks, great friction the whole way down, just head down backwards. The crux of the descent was the crowds. Be prepared for tons of people on a weekend, creating huge traffic jams at the cable changeovers while they reattach their prusiks. We ultimately had to just clip around people and jump between the left and right cables to get down, there were people stuck on that descent for an hour plus waiting at the changeovers.

I like that the description balances explaining that while it is the easiest route on El Cap, which is true, it is still fairly complicated (the success rate as of 2019 is around 40%). If you are under 120 lbs / 55 Kg, and are not adept at mountaineering style ascents with talus and third and fourth class terrain (there are fixed ropes, but it is still very strenuous with a pack), this route might be more difficult than the Nose - the aiding is more difficult than the Nose, it is lower-angled so the bolts are very, very reachy so slower and difficult for shorter folks, and just getting all your stuff up to the route is pretty stout. That said, if you climb in backcountry trad areas regularly, can hike around decently with a heavy pack, then LF will be easier than the Nose and super fun.     This route is definitely not popular to rappel, don't know where that info came from. (It is possible for light, in-a-day teams to rap, but most are so cooked at the end they find the 1.5 hr walk down way easier and faster). We should just say that this route is set up with rappel anchors (a dedicated rap route takes you from Thanksgiving Ledge, straight back down to the route, avoiding the upper, wandry climbing).    The release of The Pod in November 2019 from G7, the world's first inflatable portaledge / inflatable sleeping pad combo, will change the logistical challenges of Lurking Fear greatly (email me if you want to borrow / rent my inflatable ledges). Basically, most teams need a portaledge only for their first night on the wall, and the extra work required to get the portaledge all the way up to the route, and haul it up the route, really wears folks out.    Folks email me with questions about the bivy ledge mid route a fair bit, so thought I would answer here. The ledge at 9.5 is only good for one, but with an inflatable ledge would be palatial. Also, it is not possible to climb to the bivy ledge and then 'lower out' back on to the route, and climb pitch 10; the best you can do with this scenario is leave your haulbag at the anchor at the ledge, both climbers rappel down to the Pillar of Despair, belay 9, then you climb pitch 10 like normal........except that the leader has to wait to haul. After the cleaner has cleaned pitch 10 they will just rappel down to the ledge anchor, attach the haul line to the haul bag, and release the haul bag. I've included a pic to show you all this (look in the photo gallery for the pic titled 'overlay of mid route ledge').   Here are some more thoughts on 'getting to the ledge,' etc.   A couple factors are in play - one major one being that pitch 10 is one of the harder pitches on the route, so that slows things down considerable (then pitch 11 is the crux so def not good to plan on doing that before bivying, as you would be likely to run out of time).   When I climbed the route the first time I used this strategy:  1. I led pitch 10, hauled the bag up a little ways, but it was still a few meters below the elevation of the ledge.  2. My partner cleaned the pitch, like normal, but instead of clipping into the anchor they just handed me the gear sling they had just cleaned, pulled their grigri tight, and then rapped down to the bag.  3. They 'walked' the bag over to the ledge, and anchored it there.  4. They also anchored the lead line  5. I rapped down the lead line to the ledge, leaving the hauler all set up  6. In the morning, I jugged up first and started to haul (shows why it is important to pull up 4 - 5 meters of slack before fixing the lead line, so you have this as a tie in while you're hauling. When you jug back up in the morning, you just tie back into the rope, and you're all ready to start hauling safely).  7. My partner released the haul bag  8. My partner jugged the lead line also, lowering out off the anchor on the ledge (careful to not get twisted up with the bag / haul line).   Now with the new inflatable portaledge it will not be so important to reach the ledge; Pillar of Despair might be fine if you get there in the dark and don't want to deal with all this stuff (likely ;). The coolest thing about the inflatable portaledges is they are also a 4"" sleeping pad. That's right baby, 4 inch base camp pad on the Big Stone!

We rapped off of some jingus slung flake for the second rap. Strange. I really don't think we missed anything.    -the Sloan guide says use a single 60 for the first 5 chimney rappels. That is BS. You need two ropes to make the final station on rap #5 on the slab just below the chimney to take you to the ground.   -The chimney is the most likely place for you to get killed: loose rocks everywhere    Great stuff!

I didn't find any of the rapping devious or tricky to find anchors in the chimney/gulley system. In the daylight it seemed very straight-forward. On the final rappels down the steep blank wall that take you to the ground there are a few newer looking anchors that make the single 60m rope work. I think a 70 meter rope would eliminate the need to down climb the one section of 4th/5th class.    Route Notes: Hooks used - one big grappling, one medium camhook. Didn't hand place any beaks.

Flared and irregular cracks, sometimes filled with guano, bolt ladders, and blown heads makes this route an altogether different experience. But I suppose the exposure and classic bivy ledges make up for it all.   I concur with the advice of linking 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9. Older topos note ""fixed"" sections of A1 and ""bad"" bolts. None of that is true today. Almost every bolt has been replaced. Most of the fixed sections aren't, at least until reaching a slew of pitons near the top. What was A1 pins is now C2 camming in pin scars. You'll want two sets of Aliens and/or Totems or similar. Three sets is better if you are going to link pitches. We needed nothing larger than a #3 Camalot.   Our descent via the Leaning Tower Chimney took 9 or 10 raps, all from good anchors, along with two short sections of class 3/4 downclimbing. After a single-rope rap from the summit ridge to a good tree, a 60m rap reaches to within a few feet of the ground (3rd class to reach terra firma). All the raps in the Chimney are from bolted anchors and less than 30m in length, the first two of which are vertical or overhanging. As you exit the Chimney and move a few feet to climbers right, break out a second rope (if you have one) for a 55m rap to the ground. Intermediate anchors exist to break the the two longer raps for those with only one rope. There is some loose rock in the Chimney. The descent could take 4+ hours to reach the parking lot. Probably not something to try for the first time by headlamp. Bivy ledges don't get better than the one at the top of Pitch 10.  ","Portland, OR",Yosemite Valley,106187777,5.7,beginner,"Jul 5, 2020"

We had two sets of Totems, a set of regular cams (mix of aliens and Metolius ultralight master cams) five offset cams, two #3 camalots, two #4 Camalots, a full set of offset nuts from micro to the largest DMM, and regular nuts. Aid gear, we had camhooks, a few beaks of various sizes, a grappling hook and a talon (had a cliff hanger too but that got dropped on the first pitch).   I led pitches 1, 2, 4 and 8 as listed in the Sloan book, and my pal Julian had the others.    I was glad I had two 4’s for the last pitch. Used both.   The totems were clutch. Fit everywhere we placed them. Neither of us took a single lead whip the whole time.   For anyone who can do this route without hooks, kudos to you. I had to use a beak and the grappling hook just to get through the C2 section on the first pitch. Wasn’t til afterwards that I re-read a comment here to the effect of “ignore the fixed nut to the left of the first bolt ladder; it goes nowhere.” I clipped it, pulled up to it, and then had to use the beak to be able to reach the hook placement. After that was able to get another totem in and it was over. But that was a funky tricky section.   I also used the beak and the hook again on the fourth pitch right off Guano Ledge. There are several blown heads that the beak works great with. Definitely recommend bringing at least one, probably a mid-size pecker, not the larger tomahawks.   I never placed any of the offset cams we brought, nor did I use the camhooks or the talon, and I sewed up the pitches I led. My partner and I both wound up using the totems so much that we were able to get plenty of regular cams and (usually offset) nuts in for each pitch, so the offset cams were unnecessary, as long as you have two sets of totems.    Also definitely agree this is not really a beginner route so to speak. Though there is a ton of C1 there’s plenty of hooking, C2 and spicy free moves you need to pull, and you need to know how to do a lower-out for following in a few spots. We did it in two days, taking our time. Climbed to Ahwahnee Ledge, left the haul bag, fixed pitches four and five, spent the night on the ledge, then jugged up and did the final three and had plenty of daylight for the descent.    On the seventh pitch, we had to leave a fixed Metolius 0 right after the last bolt in the roof. Thing would not budge when I tried to clean it. If you can booty it, enjoy. Just the latest in a ton of fixed pieces all over the route. There were several biners and slings clipped to various pitons and other fixed nuts, heads and the like, on nearly every pitch.   Fantastic time. Definitely recommend it. For those on here who say it's less than classic, you must be pretty damn spoiled. Perhaps the most amusing part was my pal dropped his FitBit watch off while leading pitch 7, and got it back because some kind soul found it and placed it obviously on a rock in the middle of the trail heading down. Had a cracked face but worked just fine. Damnedest thing.  ","Denver, CO",Yosemite Valley,106187777,5.7,beginner,"Jun 13, 2021"

I stupidly took a nasty tumbling fall down a gully on 4/19/12 after the climb, and would love to get these back to offset the pain of my substantial injuries.   Note that P1 and P3 were still a bit wet on 4/19/12, but given the good hand holds didn't preclude climbing (I wiped off my feet a few times after they touched wet spots).   For reference on my review, I'm 6', a 5.7/5.8 leader, and have about 100 pitches of trad under my belt all-time.   P1 is a sustained, somewhat pumpy lieback experience, but the pro is generally very good and much of it can be foot-jammed for partial rests.   P2 is an easy ramp walk-up to a great belay ledge, 5.-   P3 features epic exposure with a great crack system.  1st step right is no problem at all at my height, as you can do it statically.  Might feel more adventurous if you are about 5.8 or shorter.  Don't expect too many hand jams here, but feet will get in there a lot and the face/crack junction features serve as good hands.   P4/P5 were a bit unclear to me - we just about maxed out P3 with a 60m rope, then I found myself with options of either setting up a tree belay in the mossy face area, or a gear belay at the top of the P3 crack system under a little roof.  I chose the latter (which was fine), though if you don't surmount the roof from there, you'll need to execute a sketchy leftward traverse with no pro for a couple moves after the belay (definitely clip your belay anchors beforehand).  We went left here because SuperTopo indicated there were both left and right options, and the right option featured 5.8 friction moves over a bulge, which I wasn't excited about at the time.   After this, I lied back the left-facing mossy corner system for a bit before getting up and over the corner back onto the face right.  From here, there's a pumpy but well-protected roof move (perhaps this was the famous ""mantle""?  If so, why was there no clear mention that is was also a roof move in the SuperTopo?) that can be surmounted if you're taller by reaching up on top of the roof for bomber holds on the right.  If you're shorter, you may find this roof more exhausting.   After said roof, there were several good belay options, followed by a short romp to the top of the formation.   I'm pretty sure I missed something with the intended P4/P5, as SuperTopo didn't mention a P4/P5 roof move and I'm not sure where exactly the ""crux mantle"" move was supposed to be.

We were 2nd in line, but as we moved up we saw we were 4th in line from the 5.7 3rd pitch belay ledge. Waited a couple hours to get moving... Weather was perfect, no breeze in the evening. Warm night for the most part. No clouds.   Pitch 1: 5.9 Finger crack w/excellent smeared right feet, and left toe nubs in the crack. Difficult move is about 10 feet above the standing ledge, then it pushes a hard 4-8m  of small +/- 2 finger locks giving way to hand jams and a clean finish. Belay at the Tree, but don't spend too much time there.   Pitch 2: 5.6 Chimney-Esque? Well, I mostly walked up the low angle, then did a lay back for the chimney section. You could get a 3 in under the flake to protect it, or you could just push through 10 ft to some great jugs. I dont think I protected it much other than a .75 about 3m. up... very short.   Pitch 3: 5.7 Hand Crack w/small finger locks and some stemming. Things get a little more vertical here for the 1/2 then you'll reach the belay ledge below the next pitch. Highly exposed, but it's all there. Used lots of c3's 1.s and .75.s if I remember - Otherwise nuts all day.   Sun starting to Set here and the darkness is creeping in.   Pitch 4. Shoot right and around, then back left across a face traverse. There is protection on a crack that shoots up before the traverse.. after the traverse head up thing crack with great feet. I set up a belay under the ledge and before the bulge which reminds me of double cross in JTree. I had some rope drag because I may have over protected the traverse not knowing how it was going to unfold. Also, I didn't see a tree.. maybe I didn't go far enough over.   Night Fall w/Headlamp - Definitely Awesome Climbing!   Pitch 5: I hopped over the bulge and climbed all the way to the bottom of the crux mantle area. I don't remember much of this, but great feet and stable hands. Definitely enjoyable and exciting in the dark. Feet are really able to smear on the rock from the angle. Set up an anchor at the bottom left of the crux move area. There is a small ledge 3m bottom right diagonal where I through in some 3's and even a 4.   Pitch 6: Set a couple cams in the undercling area, and a couple nuts in the left crux crack pocket. A nice x4 will also fit half way up. High hands, high right foot, stem left, and reach for two left sided nubs, one near and one far and beach yourself on that ledge. Nuts can go in the left side, or skip and move right about 3m of face to the crack.. and it's pretty much clear from there... up another 30m or so.. I was pretty beat, and my partner wanted to lead a pitch early but wasn't up for it.. I set the gear for the crux and her 5.2 60kg frame flew right up it. Its probably the easiest of the 5.8 pitches. Felt easier than the 5.7 earlier.   Descent: Left gully has wrap Rap wring about 10 m down. Rap to the deck, then scramble down.. scramble right when you dont think you can go any further and you'll run into a trail that will take you down some rocks and dirt. It's well defined. From there you can walk home.   We finished this route about 1130 PM in the full moon light. It was one of the best experiences I've had. The descent down can be pretty long 1+ hour so add that in the total climb time. We didn't get back until about 115 or so..    Also, my partner left some of my nuts in the route on 9-17. She didn't have a head lamp and couldnt pull them. Maybe 2-3 if she told me right. please email me at joeytolle at gmail.com respond here.    Another great Yosemite trip!

Belayed off of a ledge right at the base of the small lichen lieback and barely made it to the sling horn at the top of P3 (10ft of rope left with a 70m!). Will have to come back and try the awesome looking pitch #1! The frogs at the top of P3 gave me a scare when placing cams in their home to build a belay, cute lil fellas.

I think a couple moves on this route would warrant a 5.9-10 rating if they were transplanted to other crags. Still, super fun and memorable climbing.     Quick pitch-by-pitch:   P1: Maybe the technical crux for me? The last 20' of the lieback and pulling around the corner at its top are fairly tricky. Purple camalots are your friend.    P2: Cakewalk, basically walking up a ramp. Could probably be combined with P1 if you don't mind pulling a ton of rope drag.   P3: Kinda scrappy TBH. We found a seep coming out of the main route along the upper ~20', with slimy moss in the crack which made both climbing and protecting it pretty tricky.    P4: Harder than the infamous mantle. Slabby runout from the belay, then a bulge mid-route that is very protectable but somewhat tricky. The rest is balancy shallow cracks up the slab.   P5: The mantle. Grab the jug, throw your right foot up high onto the shelf and pull it. Really not bad, especially if (like me) you're more comfortable with face holds than crack climbing. Honestly nice to have a real hold to grab after all the flaring cracks on P4!  ","Seattle, WA",Yosemite Valley,105833505,5.8,beginner,"Jan 31, 2022"

We were lucky to start early at 8:30am with not a soul in sight, and somehow managed to have the route to ourselves the entire time on the wall. The end of the first pitch had a tiny bit of water running down the left side of the belay, but not enough to wet our shoes or the rope to any noticeable degree. The rest of the climb was totally dry, in addition to the perfect spring weather.   This was my first full 5.8 multipitch lead and I must admit that almost all pitches (aside from P2) were pretty heady! I lead every pitch, and as a budding 5.8/5.9 leader (having led roughly ten 5.8 pitches and five 5.9 pitches), I felt like this was at my mental limit. The bulge and the mantel look more difficult than they are, and most of the face climbing feels spicier than it is. Most of the climb has awesome exposure, and most every pitch offered varied crack and face climbing that put me in a state of constant focus. I found every pitch to be quite enjoyably protectable, with near obvious gear placement every 10-15ft as you get higher on the route; only once or twice did I find myself in a rest well above my previous piece without any obvious placement before me. This climb eats nuts, but also accepts cams if you keep an eye out for the parallel cracks. It was my wife's first valley 5.8 multipitch (with only a single 5.8 follow the day previous) so she struggled with several pitches, asking for a few takes in order to rest briefly or to work on a difficult nut. There is a single true ledge belay (top of P2, after an easy jaunt up a 5.4 ramp) and the rest are semi-hanging, so expect some slight harness/shoe discomfort if you're just breaking into multipitching; however, the climbing is amazing and well worth it! Overall, my wife and I had an amazing day on the The Nutcracker, taking 5hrs from base to summit and eating a well deserved lunch at the top while taking in the beautiful Yosemite views and enjoying the heavenly weather.   The descent is mostly straightforward, fun, 5th class down-scrambling for a bit until you come to an obvious steep, rocky, switchbacked dirt climber's trail; easily follow the path back to the picnic area parking lot.    If interested, here are my comments on each pitch:  P1) 5.8 lieback that gets a bit more left leaning and more secure as you get to the top; the mental crux for me was gaining the lieback position and the first few moves after. After pulling up and over to the final section, easier 5.5/5.6 section, belay at the base of the 5.4 ramp. This pitch might be the crux if you lack solid lieback/corner crack skills.  P2) An easy scramble up a 5.4 ramp to a beautiful, large, reassuring belay ledge (we belayed from the existing natural rock anchor comprising nylon runners)  P3) An exposed step to the right to gain a sequence of arcing finger/hand cracks that you can lieback or finger jam with good feet until you traverse to a wider crack on the left up to a gear belay. I used 2 large nuts and a #1, positioned slightly past am obvious natural rappel anchor, underneath a roof like feature that you climb up the right side of to begin the next pitch.  P4) Climb right around the bulge/roof like feature and then to the left with some heady face climbing to the actual ""bulge"" marked in the topos. The bulge has a 5.8 splitter hand crack in it, so just focus on getting high feet on the bulge face or foot jamming the crack and sink those jams to pull up and over to a fun, longer wide finger crack leading up to the final, slabby, featured, belay position.  P5) Climb up and left on a featured slab to a large bulge feature and gain the crack system in a semi-left facing corner for a few moves until you perform the infamous mantel move! Get high feet and pull on some jugs on the top, and there's a nice little ledge to rest on before tackling the airy face climb to gain another wide, slabby finger crack all the way to the top. Just follow the path of least resistance and you'll find good but likely unnecessary pro all the way straight to the top. I belayed from natural anchors at the top, and extended the anchor so I could see my wife as she victoriously finished this fun and challenging Yosemite classic.

We warmed up on Keystone Corner on Wednesday, July 22, 2020, and while it does look like someone bolted the anchor within the last year or so, I was able to pull one of the three out with my bare hands.  The hanger on said bolt also had a deep cut in it, almost as if someone took a grinding wheel to it.  It never should have been used on a bolt to begin with.  The bolts used are 9mm euro-style steel expansion bolts with Metolius hangers, but whoever installed them didn't tighten the hanger on enough to engage the expansion sleeve.  It looked as though they only hand-tightened the nut and then placed a drop of bolting glue on the end of the nut/bolt to keep it from unscrewing.  They may have also drilled a 3/8"" hole for the 9mm bolt.  The rightmost of the three bolts seems okay upon initial inspection, but the left is somewhat loose and the middle came out with only a few tugs with my bare hand.  This anchor is not safe, period, especially when you consider this is a trade route that sees a lot of novice climbers running toprope laps up it.  I'll post a photo of the hanger in the photo section for the route.  I'll also post on the bolt replacement threads.  If anyone has any information on who put these in, please reach out to me.  I have no intentions of putting them on public blast.  I would rather give them the chance to reeducate on bolting before they do it again.

For reference, I'm 6' and a solid 5.7/5.8 leader with about 100 pitches of trad under my belt all-time.   Definitely felt like the crux was the leftward traverse on P1.  Analyze where your pro will be on this section ahead of time, as it's a critical spot to protect you and your follower and there aren't a ton of placement options.  Climbing this in April, though our route was dry, the friction feet were still not 100% dry on the rock, making this section feel committing.  That said, I committed and had no problem getting through it traversing hands on the small crack and using friction feet on the face.  I later saw another climber put feet in the crack and use undercling hands in the same crack as well for this part, which looks like it might have felt easier (though probably would have made the pro more awkward).   After the traverse on P1, if you've got big hands you'll be treated to an all-too-short splitter crack, followed by the aforementioned tree belay (good idea).   For P2, I found the roof move right above the tree to be easy with my big hand jams, but my 5'2"" female partner with small hands had quite a bit more difficulty with it.

If you're a budding 5.8/5.9 leader, don't do this but if you're comfortable, it's mucho better.   -Simul rap to climbers L , two raps is nice and easy, as the topo indicates. Climbing on an 80 allows you to make it to the descent ledge (8ft below the belay ledge).  -P1 traverse is very protectable w/ a yellow or purple totem, though slightly awkward.  -I overprotected (mostly for my followers sake) with the following totems: 2 blue, 2 purple, 3 yellow, 2 green, 2 red, 1 orange and a bd #2. Surprised to not use any black...Probably could use half of that but be nice to your follower if they're new. Otherwise, go as light as you want. Protecting the top of the L side crack approaching the P1 belay is not totally necessary and will help rope drag a ton if you don't. It can be done w/ a bd #2 or #3, if you choose to. A #2 can be used at the roof but an orange totem will work fine as well (approx 1.8).  ",Morro Bay,Yosemite Valley,105939242,5.8,beginner,"Oct 5, 2019"

Take this up low angle terrain to a glorius steeper hand crack splitter.  Pull an offwidth move or two ( or not if you have the length) and you'll rejoin the original 10b lieback corner to the finish.  There is amazing protection through out this pitch.     You can rap from dinner ledge using a single 70 m.  Just make sure you knot your ends!  The first rap from dinner just barely gets you down to the top of pitch 2. You can rap the route from there.        ","Logan, UT",Yosemite Valley,105847471,5.8,beginner,"Jun 8, 2012"

This avoid quite nicely the eating flake.  -To start pitch 11, Don't go directly left!! This chimney is not part of the climb, from the amound of slings on the tree on top, seems a lot of people did that mistake. To haul pitch 11, put the haul bag on the slab on the right.  - For hauling pitch 12, setup a far hauling system with the rope fixed on the highest tree, nearby the bivy site.   All in all a beautiful climb. Most difficult move for me was a super weird cam hooking move on top of pitch 6 just before the bolt before the anchor. (I guess a head popped there).

I had twice hiked up to this climb previously only for a partner to realize they'd forgotten something important (shoes, then rope), so last weekend was dubbed Revenge on Braille Book.   The first pitch was kinda hollow sounding and loose, but the second/third pitches were righteous fun, and there's even chockstones to sling at a couple of the cruxes if you need to pull through. Did the 5.10c handcrack variation, which I would highly recommend. I placed more gear on that mini pitch than the rest of the climb combined I think, and the airy finish out climbers left is a *must* do.    I brought a #4 and a #5, and my friend's team brought two #4's. At the end of the day, we both thought that we would have been better off with the other's rack. Don't forget thin nuts if you want to protect the chimney at the end of the third pitch. It's not super hard, but a slip would definitely end in a broken back if you don't use the thin seam going up the left wall of the chimney for gear.

You could probably get a few small pieces in the unprotected face up top to get to the 2 bolt belay at the start of pitch 2, but the moves are easy if you can climb the 5.8 crack.  At the second belay use long slings or your rope to allow you to stand on the ledge and not hang.  If you want to do the 5.8 lieback first pitch on the left bring big gear.  Probably at least 2 #4 camalot's maybe even a #5, but I didn't do it because I went up to it with a #3 and it was too small at the start so I did the 5.8 hand crack.  So that beta is just from viewing it from below.  The whole thing looked wide all the way up, but you can lieback it and not OW.  It looks fun.   Pitch 2 is easier, 5.7 mostly, with some nice lieback sections and good gear.  We made a natural anchor in horizontals about 10' below the big roof.     Pitch 3 The roof accepts mid sized cams - maybe #1-#3 camalots as it varies in size, I used a #1.  Then move right while jamming up into the roof.  It really isn't so bad if you hand jam decently.  If you reach up and left after the roof there is a huge horn that takes the sting out of everything...though the lieback section to the top is continuous and I thought harder than the roof itself.  The exit move is a bit funky and be very careful to not knock rock down on climbers below you.  The slope up top is very loose...I would suggest walking high into the trees to belay.  On the walk off - there is a rap at the cliff band if it is wet.     Stellar route and you have 2 pitches to gaze up at the roof and wonder how hard it is...

Apparently there have been several injuries, including a friend of mine who broke her foot last year while simulclimbing third at the end of the rope (her husband was tied in 20' above her, unfortunately there was some slack between when she fell about 7 or 8 feet). The start is best protected by stepping up the trunk and placing gear as high as you can reach. Keep a tight belay for the follower(s). Some crack climb the start, others (like me) layback it, and one of my friends thought the knobs to the right of it were easier.   For the crux overhang on pitch 3, switching hands in the horizontal crack below the overhang is tricky. Once you've got your left hand set, reach your right hand up and right for a huge jug along the outside edge of the ROOF about a foot out from the vertical crack in the corner above the roof.

For P3 you'll see the orange rock / ""rotten chimney"" and a big fin-like buttress.  Normal route goes in back of (to the left) this fin and the direct just continues in the corner then does a quick move onto a bit of the face.  Really nice - small nut and small cam protect well.   For P4, I did the shattered rock variation, but if your aim is to do the steep 5.9 crack finish (recommended), you can actually just do the normal P4 and then hop up to the ledge off to the right of where you would belay to set up a belay for the P4 crack.

We found the topo in the Sloan et al guidebook for those pitches confusing. I'm not really sure there is a good way to describe where to go other than just follow the path of least resistance.   Regarding the approach: It was relatively easy to find the 5.6 slab that marks the base of the route. The gigantic right facing corner that is to the right of the route is also very clear from the base. Go up the gully to the right of the slab. Don't bother climbing the slab itself - it is unprotected and kinda sketchy in approach shoes. At this point, you might want to put climbing shoes on, but my advice is to stay unroped. Leading this pitch creates heinous rope drag. Climb up and left. Eventually you get to a grassy ramp that has been trampled. Continue up the ramp and up some blocky terrain until you see a steep gully with some trees on the left. The first ""real"" pitch starts at the top of the gully. We climbed the left-facing corner that is somewhat dirty and vegetated. It gets cleaner the higher you go.   Regarding the topout: After the last 5.9 pitch, continue up and climber's right.

In this case the descent is long, and creates major erosion walking down Michael's Ledge, so from a ecological standpoint a rappel route is preferred. I've descended both ways, and think rappelling is way better because it is much faster, and doesn't involve the scrambling to get up / on to Michael's Ledge.   As many have said, rapping with one 70m is no problem. There are bolts on the top of the first 5.9 pitch. From the base of this pitch walk downhill on a grassy hillside until you have to make a couple downclimbing moves (5.3) and you can look skier's left and see a rappel station on a ledge.

You'll end up in an obvious gully with a grassy left crack and varied wide / chimney section on the right. I don't recommend roping up for the approach. If you feel uncomfortable on easy 5th moves unroped, you might not belong on this route!  -P1: Chimney moves are awesome!  -P2 (the long splitter pitch): If you do it in one long pitch, you might want triples of #1 and maybe a couple other common pieces. If split into two, belay around the horn that sticks out left and it's a little uncomfy. I see that some people went right to the wide corner to LB after the horn, but I'm not sure why. Straight up past the tree was fine and a little wide.  -P3: Crux for me on entire route was the 5.9 fingery LB on the last pitch, but it was superb. Maybe I'll opt for the OW finish next time.  -Descent beta: Walkoff looks a little better than the rapp IMO because of snag potential. 1) Head right around the first set of boulders behind the summit 2) You'll see a corner, go up this with an easy 5th lieback letting you know you're on the right track 3) keep going up and stem. A little exposed at the top but easy. 4) Travel left through dirt and a little bit of bushes to the trail. A couple cairns and evidence of being travelled will let you know you're on the correct descent.  ","San Francisco, CA",Yosemite Valley,106451171,5.9,intermediate,"Dec 18, 2017"

I placed an almost fully open #5 ~10 feet above the tree and then it gets too wide for anything but the super wide stuff for the next ~20 feet to the roof. It's probably R without a #5, and PG-13 with it given the ledge below you. Seems weird no one would mention this?  3.

If it had an easier approach and descent there would be very long lineups on this route. Good climb. For the approach walk up and right from the toe of Lower Brother. As you walk up look left for some cairns going up through the bushes. The photos found here are somewhat helpful. If you go up too far the ground will level off to the right. Turn around and go back looking for the cairns - they will be easier to find on the way back. The climbing up to the base of the route is 3rd and 4th class. Many people will want and or need a rope. It is about 80 meters from the cairns to the base of the route. Look for rappel stations as you are climbing up through the approach. There are three all very close to one another about halfway through the approach. One is good, the other two -not so good. Go relatively straight up from the rappel station (the one with the rings on a good live tree). This will lead you to the base of the climb. For pitch 1 we took the 5.9 finger/hand crack that breaks out left instead of the chimney offwidth straight up. It was ok but there were a lot of tree leaves and dirt in the cracks taking a lot of the fun away. I found it also had tricky movement with only pg gear near the crux. If you follow through with this variation taking the logical path it will lead you up to a couple of cool layback, left facing corners (fun!). Continue moving up and right through easier terrain. Problem is this brings you about 30 feet above the bolted belay/rappel station. It's not really a problem. You can easily build a gear anchor here and belay on a nice ledge. You can still get to the second pitch ok but be aware you will actually be bypassing the beginning of pitch 2. For pitch 2 we followed the splitter cracks. I did it in one long pitch. For the crack up to the tree I used just two #1 C4's. I did bump them a few times. The crack is ok but not perfect hands which makes it less enjoyable. Your 10 year nephew might be able to find perfect hand jams on this but most will not. After the tree (optional belay) the crack widens to fists and slightly bigger. There may have been some finger and hand jams way inside. I bumped a #3 a long way and exited via the beauty corner near the top just below the ledge. The next time I would head right into the left facing corner  near the bottom and follow it right to the top. It is gorgeous. For pitch 3 I went straight up into the big groove which is super cool and then got into the off width. I have climbed many Yosemite offwidths in the last month and this one is by far the most enjoyable with excellent protection. The #5 was really nice here. It fit well and was bumped all the way up. A pumpy layback will have you exit the crux of the offwidth and then up easier climbing to a small ledge below the chimney. I took a look at that chimney and almost bailed right to easier looking flakes but decided to suck it up and go for it. Glad I did this thing is the best part of the entire climb. So fun and good pro. We decided to rappel the route and with a 70 meter rope it works just fine but beware the first rappel is a bit of a rope stretcher to the ledge. Four raps for the climb and one or two for the approach. A short rappel here takes you to the tree (optional belay) on pitch 2 and then the bolted station for pitch 1 will take you to the ground. A word of caution re loose rock should be mentioned. On every ledge there are loose rocks that could easily be dislodged. Wear helmets and tred lightly. I had a double rack to #2, single #3,4 and 5, 10 draws. You could use the 4 and 5 on every pitch.  ",,Yosemite Valley,106451171,5.9,intermediate,"Sep 29, 2018"

The descent is pretty easy from there but no one places any cairns in this upper section because they're lost too.

Protects well and is great to break into 5.9 multipitch. I was pleasantly surprised to find it completely empty on a nice Saturday in May; the approach and involved descent must keep the crowds away.   I pitched this out as 5 shorter pitches. This resulted in little to no rope drag and let me have a tight belay above some ledges. The route description doing it this way would be as follows:   Pitch 0: junky approach pitch, rope up if/when you feel like it. Lots of 4th/low 5th terrain everywhere, hard to tell what the path of least resistance is.   Pitch 1: Climb the steep chimney, which looks intimidating but is actually fairly casual. Good jams and holds appear when you need them. Exit the chimney to a ledge on the right with a bolted anchor (and some tat as of May 2021). This pitch was very fun and creative.   Pitch 2: Climb the nice handcrack just to the right of the bolted anchor. You will get to a ledge on the left, but don't belay here; do some face climbing up and right to get to a higher ledge on the right that is right at the base of the splitter crack. Build a gear anchor here, it means you will have little rope drag and a tight belay for the tougher finger crack right off the ledge, which will be comforting if 5.9 is near your limit. This is a short pitch but it's fun and a good warmup for the tougher thin hands on the next pitch.   Pitch 3: Start up the finger crack which quickly turns into a splitter thin hands crack. Bring several number BD #1s. Belay at the obvious tree growing out of the crack. This is a great pitch!   Pitch 4: Continue up the crack (not the corner to the right of the crack), which gets a little wide right above the tree. You can reach deep inside the wide crack for wide hand jams; BD #3s are great here. I found this section very physical but at the same time very secure. Pull a fun small roof using great holds, and continue up the left facing corner to a nice ledge with trees. Another great pitch! Belay high up on the ledge at the base of whichever finish variation you choose; I built a gear belay right underneath the start of the lieback variation, which is marked by a short left facing corner below a small roof. You could easily combine this with the previous pitch; it wouldn't result in extra rope drag, and it would protect well as the previous pitch wants BD #1s whereas this pitch wants #3s and maybe a #4; it would also skip the hanging belay at the tree.   Pitch 5: I did the lieback variation, which is a fantastic pitch. Follow the short left facing corner, pull around the small roof, and continue up and occasionally to the right on liebacks and finger cracks in corners.   We decided to rope up for one short section of the approach, but didn't feel the need to rope up for the scramble to Michael's Ledge. Both have some easy 5th class sections.   Pro: I brought triples of hand size cams (BD 0.75-3) which was nice to have to really sew up the 5.9 handcrack sections; doubles in smaller sizes. You could get away with doubles with some bumping/backcleaning. I brought a #4 which was nice in a few spots but not really necessary. No #5 as I did not do the OW variation for the last pitch. Also nuts which I used sparingly.  ","Albuquerque, NM",Yosemite Valley,106451171,5.9,intermediate,"May 10, 2021"

This would be my recommendation to anyone - go light, but take enough water to survive 2 days.  Skimp on everything you can, or else the chimney and endless traverses will teach you misery.   Some other suggestions:  Be competent at 5.9 lead, lead what you can, and yank on anything else .  This is an alpine climb.  Fix ropes the day before - we fixed P1-P3, I believe.  Then jug before dawn.  Take the 5.7 airy chimney - look for the bolts.  Use some French free.  A great example for this is pitch 12.  Have a partner with a sick sense of humor.

The slabs approach isn't dangerous unless you make it that way. Providing the ropes are all there, stick to the left side when up in the ""slabs"" area. The trail's easier and you don't have to cross the steep talus above potentially knocking bowling balls down the slabs. That's the dangerous part, stick close by your partners and if someones ahead of you, put some distance between you and them or catch up really quick and walk with them throuhg the loose crap. Most of the route is a stroll through the woods. Only a short section has steep, wet slabs where veering off course would be dangerous. Luckly the trail's easy to follow.

Rack for a moderately paced in-a-day ascent (we aided the hard parts): single set of smallest cams, double blue tcu to #3 camalot.  Didn't need nuts, but obviously they can be placed.   5. Crux of the route for me seems like the bolt ladder pitch above thank god ledge (the second to last pitch of the route).  Bolt placement requires either a hardish (>5.9) couple of slab moves to reach a higher pendulum point or a tricky (>C1) few traversing aid moves.  This is the only section of the route where I haven't yet (after doing the route twice and climbing both options described above) found a 5.9 C1 method.   Enjoy!   Edit after another ascent in 2012: #1 is questionable advice. No bugs in late summer/early fall and the weight of a tent/bivy might not be worth it anyway. #5 is also questionable.

There are 4 crux pitches, all checking in right around 11d/12a, and all with different styles. If you want to onsight, don't read any further.    -The first free variation starts at the 2-bolt belay right before the 5.11/A1->bolt ladder pitch on the regular route (P4). From the belay, traverse left, past an old bolt (11a), then up a dihedral. There's a wide spot here, a #4 camalot is very useful(11b). Belay just below the obvious Higbee-Hedral boulder problem. There's a fixed pin at the top of the 12' steep corner, with plenty of tat hanging down so that you can clip it for a top rope. A few moves of strenuous stemming lead to a sloping mantel (11d/12a). At this point, you can drop a loop of slack back down to your belayer and haul up the rack for the rest of the pitch, allowing you to have nothing on your harness for the crux. The remainder of the pitch is fun 5.11, mostly liebacking and stemming, trending right and rejoining the regular route midway through its 5th pitch.   -There's a long free variation around the Robbins traverse and bolt ladder. Continue up the prominent corner/gully system past the Robbins for about another pitch length. Make an exposed 5.10 traverse past some large loose flakes, and then downclimb a strenuous 5.9 corner (I thought the downclimb was harder than the traversing part, so maybe it's closer to 5.10). The downclimb drops you back onto the regular route, on the large ledge below the chimney pitches. There is some fixed gear with a biner at the top of the downclimb, the second should leave this clipped for top rope pro. With a 60m rope, you'll need to belay at the base of the downclimb (instead of the bolts 20' further along the ledge) in order to have enough rope for the second to make it down. With a 70m, you can belay at the bolts.   -There's a few variations to the first chimney pitch, which supposedly had some tight 5.9 squeeze on it. The crack to the left of the chimney can be climbed at 5.11, and apparently the short traverse back to the main route can be done free at a similar grade. I have not done any of these options.   The best way on this pitch, in my opinion, is to start up the chimney (easy and spacious at this point), and then traverse deep into the chimney towards a body-sized window a little ways in. Step through the window and pull up into a splitter finger crack (5.10)! Climb this until it veers off right, then make a short, face-y traverse (also 5.10) back left to the regular route. This variation is excellent, well-protected, and airy.   -The remaining chimney pitches and some easy traversing pitches (easy to simul) lead to Big Sandy ledge and the start of the ZigZags. The Zags are the meat of the tough climbing.   The first pitch features clean finger crack climbing for a while (11a) to a good stance. From here, battle up a short, thin, pinscarred layback to a distinct crux move (12a). A plethora of fixed nuts protect this section. Above here, one more hard move is encountered: a reachy 5.11 face move (the aid route tension traverses here).   -The second Zag is probably harder than 5.10 (as given by some topos). I'd say 11b. The crux of this pitch is pulling over a small roof. This can be combined with the previous pitch, as long as your careful with drag.   -The third ZigZag gives you two options: straight up the aid line (12+?), or out right on another thin crack (12a). The easier way goes right just off the belay, underclinging with good, but strenuous to place small gear (an extra blue or green alien is nice here). The difficulty eases as you turn from underclinging to laybacking, but there's a crux coming higher (when you're nice and pumped). As the angle of the corner eases, the crack pinches down and you have to make some thin moves. Above here, rejoin the regular route for some 5.10 crack climbing to the belay before Thankgod ledge.   -The final bit of hard climbing comes on the slab/bolt ladder pitch after TG ledge. Climb the steep slab with small, slope-y holds past the closely spaced bolts (11d). After clipping the bolt with all the tat (the one the aid route penji's off of), you have to make a short run to the next bolt (10' or so, a bit exciting). From that bolt, continue up to a horizontal crack system, then traverse easily left on it to the belay.   One more wandery 5.8 pitch and you've sent!

May 2nd, 2015.  The spring is running strong and is the best and coldest water you will ever taste.  I promise.   The chimney pitches, specifically pitches 13 and 14, are by far some of the best chimney climbing I have ever experienced and are easily linked with a 60 (we had a 70).  Stellar movements mixed with great airy exposure and an absolutely in your face view of the high country makes for some very memorable climbing.  The 5.9 squeeze variation really does not look fun, and I really don't understand why anyone in there right mind would want to try it (I guess after doing the route enough times, you look for ways to spice it up).  For an idea of how squeezey it is, there is a 1L Nalgene stuck deep in the crack.  Small.   We started the route at 5:26 am and were able to make Big Sandy by 6 pm.  Definitely not going for any speed record here, but I felt like it was a reasonable time, albeit we could have moved a little quicker through some of the lower pitches.     Things really begin to slow down at the ZigZags, which, even after linking and short-fixing, still took us three hours to overcome.   Pitch 21 is where I really began to run into trouble.  The hooking is not straight-forward, and after a slip of my foot while reaching for a bolt, I had a cam hook snap in half.  This pitch really requires you to keep your head together, which gets difficult after 21 pitches and many hours of climbing, and the vizor is less than 50 feet over your head.  I ended up whipping three times due to hooks blowing.  I was very stoked to reach the three-pin belay.    The final pitch can be completely freed.  Although the friction climbing is spooky, it goes a lot easier than it appears.  Do not aid.  Do not.   Rope drag crippled my partner on this pitch, and even prevented him from making the final (amazing) 5.7 mantel move for the top out.  He had to give his all into pulling enough rope to pulling over the lip.  He ended up fixing the rope because it would have taken too much to pull up the rope to put me on belay.  Very frustrating.     Nonetheless, we topped out at 2:20 in the morning after 21 hours, and only a 30 minute break.

I'd recommend not jugging these rappel lines to preserve them.     The first lower out on Pitch 12 takes a sideways hook mid-swing to help get over to the 5.5 mantel.  In addition, the knot toss Pitch 12 is fairly trivial.

A 70m just reaches the deck from top of P2. The rope did not retract on us after getting off (fixed rope on P4; knotted midway to deal with a rupture). Linked P5-6 and P8-9. All pitches went fairly quick except P12 (took a long time in spite of getting the toss on the first try; fig-8 on a bight with a biner worked fine). The first tension traverse was not too bad but the mantle move was tough. **The bolt at the rope toss is missing** (can see the sleeve where it used to be). Instead there's a fixed #1 brassy at that location. Works for now and was in good shape. Was a decent rope and longer 5mm cord hanging below the anchor of P12. Linked P13-15 with our 70m. Did an unplanned but prepared-for bivy at Sandies (emergency bivy sack & down jacket was enough given the hot weather). No other surprises beyond that. Great climb!!!

For those familiar with the route, ignore the rest of the post… probably more details than you’d ever want:  - the approach = the climbers trail is marked with a carabiner post, amazing!  Steph Abegg's photo (on her website,  sites.google.com/stephabegg…, and in the newest edition of Erik Sloan's book are so amazing, you can literally follow the map as you walk.  One useful thing - remembering where to exit/enter the gulleys during the descent can be elusive (especially when you're tired), so taking a picture of those turnoffs on the way up was really helpful to have on the way down.    - the springs = there's currently three springs right at the base of P1, so awesome to have access to unlimited water!   - we fixed the first two pitches = a 70m rope definitely reaches the ground unweighted, no reason to bring up any additional cord  - P4 = that crack after the bolt ladder is spectacular, a true indulgence!  - P7 = as Mark Kroese said, there are two trees, go right just below the first tree (it's 1-2 moves of 5.8, a mantle, and then immediately step out right and climb up and right through the flakes to a horizontal row of manzanita to set the belay)  - P8 = go horizontally right (not up, and actually there are a few steps down) around the corner, into the gulley, do a few moves of 5.7-5.8, and then set the belay when the large ledge taking you to P9 anchor pillar connects to the gulley.    - P9 = the destination is the top of a pillar (as someone said) which is marked with the white stripe of P10s bolt ladder.  Just walk along the big prominent ledge to the right side of the pillar, and you'll see large horizontal flat ledges that take you right up to the anchor.  The 5.9+ section for the left approach is totally unnecessary, the right side of the pillar is an easy 4th scramble to the anchor.    - P12 = we broke this into two pitches because... uhhhh, a friggin wall rat chewed 30ft of our rope to bits while we had it fixed the night before so we had to chop it (if doing this as one pitch, I think you may need a 70m to have enough rope for penji’s).  The belay is basically a splitter crack sized 0.75s, but you can sneak a #0.5 and #1 in there too for an anchor.  Also - no more rope toss!  Three new bolts take you right to the base of the chimney  - P13-P14 = the chimneys are casual, but i will say that taking the 5.7 airy way does not leave you with much pro for about 20'.  Even though this airy section is wide, i'm 5'10"" and did not feel overextended chimneying, did not need to stem.  I did find a single brass nut was nice to keep the runout from being too long, but regardless, it's standard chimney technique... and just like they say in the valley, it's one of those sections where ""your protection is your technique.""  - P17 = alright... I went too high.  here's my learning... a fun perfectly sized hand crack widens to a #4 size crack reminiscent of Moby Dick, and half way up i was thinking, this is fine, but not really fun... if the topo calls this pitch ""fun"" then maybe i'm off-route... so i down led, and realized this = after 10' up the fun hand crack, and before the crack widens to a #4 OW, a few knobs appear on the face to the right of the crack that allow you to exit right to a big ledge.  Take this exit, and bam!  Big Sandy!   - P18 = if you're going to sleep on Big Sandy, it's really nice to fix the first pitch of the zig zags.  Fortunately we had time left in the afternoon to do this, and glad we did because another party arrived at Big Sandy late at night (like 3am late, wow, hardcore!) and it was really nice to be able to get a head start when we all woke up in the morning.   - Thank God Ledge = the ledge is as iconic as you imagined, does not disappoint!  Takes #1, #2, and a #3, clip a bolt, jam the corner chockstone, and use an amazingly convenient right foot next to the bolt to get into the OW.  You could probably aid through it with a #5, but without the 5, you’re gonna have to do it yourself.  Go right side in, and also amazingly convenient is a delicious crisp 2-pad crimp for your right hand that let’s you get purchased in the squeeze, and from there it’s 2 moves of OW and you’re done.    - P22 = 2-3 5.6 free moves to get the bolt ladder, penji and with the help of a black totem and a hook, you can get the second left bolt ladder.  From here, there is no other penji, after the top bolt, do 1-2 hook moves to a fixed nut and this will allow you to step left to the belay ledge.   - P23 = 5.7 slab that has a great right crimp to allow you to place that first piece of gear, and then you traverse left under the shelf until it ends in nice 5.5 big ledges to the top.

Below is some detailed beta for the Approach, Descent, General Info, Route Beta, Ropes and linking pitches. We were lucky to have a beautiful sunny day with temps in the 70’s and one friendly party of two behind us. It was a fun, successful climb without any major issues.   Approach  We followed the approach directions and topos from the Sloan book “Rock Climbing Yosemite Valley”. From the Mirror Lake trail there is an obvious wooden post with a carabiner image where you need to turn off. The drainage was not well cairned as indicated in the book and we added more cairns on our descent where they were sparse. We got shut down by a chance of rain and ended up approaching and descending the death slabs twice. The first time we ascending the 3 hand lines and slabs on the left of the gully with heavy packs, which was somewhat treacherous. The second time we jugged the long decent rappel line on the right, which became our preferred method. It doesn’t mention it in the book, but at the top of the gully there is a fair amount of traveling (on trails) through thick brush to the base of the rock. Approach took about 4 hours.   General Beta  The spring is literally ten feet left of the start of the route and was running. We had good cell signal with Verizon at the base and for the whole route. The trees dripped sap and the mosquitoes came out right at sunset. Sphinx moths dive bombed our headlamp/face in the morning (can be avoided using a red light).   Route beta  The route had a very alpine feel, where the first half was dirty with grit and sand, but the rock quality improved for the second half. To link pitches better (especially ones with bolt ladders) and to avoid drag on traverses, we would have liked to have more than the 14 slings and long alpine draws we brought. Linking P7 and P8 created horrible rope drag.The new bolts to bypass the rope toss on P14 are very loose, so bring a wrench if you can. Some tat and spare biners would also be handy as some of the lower-out cords looked a bit rotten.    The wind really picked up as we came around the horn/corner on P17  but it kept things cool for the “sunny” (partly cloudy) Zig Zag pitches. These pitches entered the sun around 2pm. We were comfortable all day just wearing pants, t-shirts, a light polypro long sleeve, and near the end of the day a light rain jacket. We each had 3L of water and about 600 calories of food.   Ropes  The first day we climbed the first two pitches and found our “70” to be about 15 feet short. However, another party fixed the first two pitches with their brand new 70 meter rope and just made it to the ground. We ended up using an 80 meter rope, which easily worked to fix P1 & P2. The 80 was helpful to link P3 & P4 and then P5 & P6, but a 70 might work too. Also, we easily linked the chimney section, P15 & P16, with 15 feet to spare.   P22 & P23   We basically followed the same beta that John Gassel posted above. We aided P23 for the traverse section.   Descent  We started at 3:30am and without really stopping, finished at 8:30pm, 17 hrs of climbing. The descent down the cables, stairs, and climber trail took about 2 hours. To get to the cables from the top walk northeast and continue in that direction for most of the rock decent. We actually used the satellite mode in the iPhone maps app to get an idea of where to go. The cables are crazy steep and very slippery and walking down backward was easier to manage. Using gloves would be helpful too. After the cables you end up in a saddle and have to hike up and over another dome until you find the rock stairs. At the bottom of the stairs was a bear box and the regular descent trail goes right. There was supposed to be a climber trail going left, but we couldn’t find any cairns or trail so we just kept working left and stayed about the same elevation. Eventually we were forced down into a gully and found a cairned trail to follow back to camp. There was no major scrambling or anything very difficult on this part of the decent, just hiking down and across hillsides.

People often point out that there are only seven pitches rated 5.12a or harder on the Nose (only 7 out of 30!), but that doesn't mean that the rest is easy. Heck the first four pitches all have short, slippery sections of hard 5.11 that regularly spit off 5.13 climbers. And sure it gets more splitter after the first four pitches, but the exposure (and the wind!) cranks up and most folks find even the Boot Flake, a mere 5.10c, too much to free climb. To free climb the Nose is badass!...and there is a reason why only a handful of people have done it. Stats: .0000001% of all Nose climbers    2. French Free - 5.10 C1+. If you can free climb solid 5.10 multi-pitch in the Valley, like you can knock off East Butress of El Cap (awesome for getting the descent dialed, too ;), Serenity to Sons of Yesterday, Northeast Buttress of Higher Cathedral, Steck/Salathe, and maybe Freeblast, with little challenge, then climbing the Nose in three and a half days (half day fix to Sickle, first day to El Cap Tower, second day to Camp 5, third day to the top) in a french free style (free climbing half or more of most pitches and just pulling on pieces through the more difficult sections) should be easy enough. Stats: 10 - 15% of Nose climbers   3. Traditional Bigwall Style - 5.8 C2. For most of us, despite talking a good game, the aiders come out about 15 - 20 feet up the first pitch. The Nose is incredible, but it is not easy. I have climbed the Nose over 20 times and there are 5.9 pitches that I have not freed completely. Everything is harder with two ropes and lots of gear on you! That said, the Nose is awesome at this grade, and it should be encouraging to all climbers that with good physical fitness, you only have to climb 5.8 to climb the Nose! Despite how much practice aiding you did at your home crag, and how many triathlons you just competed, climbing a warm up route - with the partner(s) you intend to climb the Nose with - like South Face of Washington Column, The Reg on Half Dome, SW Face of Liberty Cap, or West Face of the Leaning Tower shortly before your Nose climb will greatly tune you into the mountains and how you can thrive on them. The Nose in this style will take you four and half days to climb - a half (to three quarter) day fixing to Sickle, day one to Dolt Tower or nearby, day two to Camp 4, day three to Camp 6, Day four to the summit(maybe with time to walk down, but why rush - enjoy a night on top!)  A fair number of folks tell me they wish they had done the East Buttress(5.10c) of El Cap before climbing the Nose, so they would have had the descent dialed, and could relax more on top. Stats: 60 - 70% of Nose climbers   4. NIAD (or NIADL - NIAD in daylight) - 5.10 C1+. Climbing 28 pitches in a day, with a casual 10 - 15 minute approach and a mellow 1 hr descent, is ridiculously good. But don't kid yourself that it is better than bivying on the route - it's awesome, but shorter lived ;). Onsighting the Niad is pretty rare. Most folks practice for the Niad by climbing the first third of the route, to Dolt Tower or Eagle Ledge, which allows you to understand how to get through the traversing lower bit efficiently. Then it's good to climb South Face of Column, SW FAce of LIberty Cap, or Reg on Half Dome, in a day to get ur systems more dialed.

It gets very windy on the Nose, and folks spend so much time on the lower part of the route dealing with second ropes that are blowing around, that these new rap stations should be super useful. There have also been numerous rescues due to stuck ropes. These new rap stations will alleviate some of the congestion from people slowing down to deal with a second rope, whether they are teams that are fixing to Sickle(have the second jug with the extra ropes in a pack!) or those that are doing a Dolt Run to practice, and will allow people to climb safer and more efficiently through the lower part of the route.   If Fixing Ropes from Sickle: You no longer have to tie your ropes together and pass knots - you rap down 190' to the first anchor, another 190' to the second anchor, and then 197' to the ground. There are anchors in between these stations for one-rope rapping.    Pros of Cons of Fixing Ropes to Sickle as opposed to hauling right from the base of Pine Line ledge:     Pros:     1. You don't have to bring all of your stuff when you start, and can remember things you might need during your initial climbing (very, very huge - if you are not super experienced with bigwall climbing this alone is probably reason enough to fix to Sickle).    2. You get to try out the climbing and exposure of El Cap without the commitment. Fix down from Sickle and take a hot shower and eat a pizza - you'll be twice as stoked!    3. Allows you a day to see which other parties are starting the route, and how their progress is going, without being stuck behind them.      Cons:   1. Fixing to Sickle means having to bring a third rope, to rap down, so if your partner is not sturdy enough to jug with a pack with two ropes in it (you lead with one rope, other two ropes go in the pack with water, wind jackets, and snacks), then you are just making more work, more hauling, just to get the ropes fixed so you can haul some more (I'm saying that you will have to haul a small bag with two ropes to Sickle Ledge, just to rap down and haul your big bag from the ground to Sickle Ledge). This is a pretty big con, and I would recommend any teams that weigh less than 115 lbs to consider if it would just be easier for them to haul from the ground, and continue climbing. (of course, you can pretty easily meet up with another party that is also fixing to Sickle, and agree to share their third rope (You would fix your two ropes down from Sickle, but just use their third rope to reach the ground), and then you only have to climb with two ropes like normal and can have all of the benefits of fixing to Sickle above).    2. You have to deal with the jockeying for position that is the reality that there are normally many parties trying to climb the Nose. When you haul right from the ground, you are on the wall, and you will quickly find a pace and rhythm of ascent that keeps you a pitch or two above or below other parties. It is common for people to share fixed lines from Sickle - so seeing one set of lines is no guarantee that you might jug up to Sickle after fixing and only find one party there. The last years have seen big traffic jams on the lower part of the route, around Sickle.    In the future, having fixed ropes from Sickle, in season, that climbers maintain but can use anytime, might go along way toward mitigating the congestion around this part of the route.   Woot!

Reading the description at the top of this page I understand now why folks might still be using the outdated Supertopo topo, and not our more current one.   1. The 11a variation to the left of the first pitch (believed to be the original first pitch of the Nose, as climbed by Harding), is now the first pitch of a new, bottom-to-top free route (5.13d, 38 pitches), and is well bolted (as is a second pitch(5.9, five bolts) to the popular Pine Line which is right below this first pitch. There is a new anchor 10'/3m down and left of the 1st pitch anchor on the Nose for this variation pitch. This could provide a convenient way for Niad or other parties to pass people on the first pitch.     2. New anchor 15' above Sickle Ledge. The pitch off Sickle Ledge, 210'/62m, has always been tricky for bigwall parties (meaning those hauling bags) because folks tend to bring a 60m haul line, which comes up short right as the leader is trying to do the last moves (steep 5.9+), to the belay. This new anchor allows you to haul your haulbag to a slightly higher anchor (best if you just do it when you are hauling to Sickle - so don't haul to Sickle and then do another 15'/5m haul, just climb up to the higher anchor (3rd class) and haul to there instead). Now the pitch off of Sickle is a manageable 190', and folks are having less epics there.   3. Bolted anchor at the base, and end, of the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. Two pitches before Camp 4, in the notoriously loose 'Grey Bands,' is the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. The belay used to be one bolt and small cams but is now two bolts. Climbers scoped and developed this variation to the original Nose route because of the ubiquitous loose rock in the entire, four pitch Grey Bands section. This is a much better way to climb toward Camp 4, and these newly bolted anchors allow more options for parties, who tend to get congested in this area. Before, folks who climbed this variation had to climb the wrong way up and right, 15'/3m, to a bolted anchor at the end of the pitch. Now there is a two bolt anchor right at the end of the Traverse, which also makes the super traversing next pitch to Camp 4 a little more straightforward.    4. Old Belay re-established belay Great Roof. For a while in the 90s and 2000s the belay for the GR was a bolt and two fixed pins at a horn right below the corner that leads to the roof. The bolt is still there, and can be used by Niad parties looking to pass, but the old belay 10'/3m below this spot, which is a nice stance ledge and is the original belay, has been re-established with three good bolts.    5. Belay below the final bolt ladder reduced in size, new bolts added for belaying higher, towards the end of the bolt ladder. While the Free Nose climbers still build a belay at the top of the final 10c crack off the Wild Stance (because the free route through the bolt ladder is wandering and stout), there is no longer a spread out belay there but instead there is one 50' higher up the bolt ladder. This helps the top-out pitches flow much smoother as now you do a longer, 135'/42m pitch off the Wild Stance, and then a short pitch to the anchor below the summit, instead of a short pitch off the Wild Stance (awesome hang), and then a long pitch over the bolts and around the slab (which is always windy and difficult to communicate through).

Haul the pig from here and your follower just needs to lower out (or swing) from the top of the Boot Flake.  Additionally you can skip another one and a half pitches of hauling by leaving the pig at the intermediate belay on pitch 19 (make sure the pig is hanging from the anchor with a fifi held upright with a prusik) and climbing up to the pitch 20 anchor.  Your follower will then clean pitch 20 and you continue up pitch 21 and haul the pig from the top of pitch 21, avoiding all the trouble of hauling the rest of pitch 19 & 20.  Hopefully this helps.

First I believe that dialing in your transitions and rope management may be the single biggest thing that could help save you time. We passed/watched quite a few parties that were building weird anchors and always doing things differently etc. the nose has bolted anchors from top to bottom and all you need to do is pre tie two quad style anchors and then when you get to the anchor you just clip it in and do what you need to do.  Recognize how to keep your haul line and lead line from tangling, and learn how to do the revolving door technique with a carabiner to move ropes in and out of each other. Practice hauling on other routes beforehand. Saw a lot of weird hauling up there that didn’t look fun. Do some shorter walls that are technically harder than the Nose. I found The Prow to be really good because it’s sustained aiding at a level that is more difficult than anything on the nose. Also hauling the last couple pitches is more difficult than any hauling on the nose.  Dial in your lower outs and techniques for following traversing terrain. The nose has gobs of traverses on it and you can waste a lot of time in that terrain if you don’t know what you’re doing.  I find when following easier low angle traverses over towers and stuff it’s sometimes easiest to just throw the gri gri on and self belay while French freeing.  Also free climb as much as possible. We didn’t free that much, but a mix of French free/free/aid goes a long way to efficiency. If you think you’ll be aiding the 5.8 glory hand crack on the stovelegs, you may want to reconsider your route choice.   I’m no expert, but these are my reflections on the trip and I feel may be more helpful than “you need a set of offsets for the nose” because though that may be true, if you’ve never placed an offset before going up on the nose, just having it isn’t go to do much for you.

On day 1 we dropped our pig at the base of the fixed lines directly below Heart Ledges. There are lines in place but they are not super awe-inspiring. We climbed Freeblast and rapped to the ground and bivied at our pig. Day 2 involved jugging and hauling to Heart ledges, and climbing to the top of El Cap spire. It was sprinkling as we ended and decided to sleep at the Alcove, which aside from the view on the spire, looked WAY more comfy that the top of the spire. Day 3 involved climbing to Long Ledges. We bivied there and this turned out to a comfortable bivy for three. My favorite bivy to date. Day 4 topped out and hiked off.   Tips:  1. Aside from the Freeblast, not many anchors are solid bolts. Many are a single good bolt and gear, or old pins and gear.    2. Link a lot of pitches. Ending above the sewer are OLD 1/4 inch bolts and a totally hanging belay. If you keep going 40 more feet it is a awesome sloping ledge.    3. The pitch above the sloping ledge is sort of confusing. You take the left most crack, and pendulum at the 1st pendulum spot. The crack you are aiming for is kinda hidden but once you swing, you will find it. There is a lot of left gear higher to the right, don't go for it, it is all off route.    4. The roof pitch is all fixed, minus once cam placement which could probably be skipped.    5. The pitch off the right, east, side of Long Ledge is NOT 5.8. It starts as easy c1, but the crack ends, the pin marked on topos is missing and mandatory 5.10 climbing is present. The climbing is probably 8+ feet above you last solid cams. Drop the rack (bring a single set for the anchor and getting to it), sac it up and fire! I actually led to the free climbing, I pussed out and Bill G. made a 3 points off dyno to a sloping side pull.   6. The ear is a hard grovel put protected. Don't bring your helmet. Also, careful with you cam placements. My last one pinched the rope and I could not pull the rope, I actually backcleaned it to get to the anchor.     7. Rap, don't hike. Its a long way. Especially when you go west instead of east. Yuck.   Enjoy! -Matt   ",,Yosemite Valley,106154042,5.9,intermediate,"May 15, 2008"

Didn't use any cam hooks or hooks.  Mostly aid climbed with moderate backcleaning.     Bivies: Hollow Flake Ledge is a nice bivy with a portaledge.  Alcove is plush (one 2 bolt anchor and one portaledge bolt, room for 3-4 pretty comfortably on the ground).  Ended up using the sloping ledge below the Teflon Corner - decent spot if you have a ledge.  The Block is as advertised - large and sloping.   Hollow Flake is pretty tame as long as you focus on the climbing and not the runout.  On SuperTopo's pitch 16, there's an intermediate anchor out left at a smaller than 4x3 ledge - continue to the 4x3 ledge.  The Ear is fantastic - walk some big gear above your head so you're on TR for the whole pitch, and backclean it so your partner doesn't curse you while jugging this thing.  Clip the bolt out right at the end for smooth rope organization.  Climbing the Sewer makes it feel like you're on an adventure - relish the wetness and then enjoy the sweet handcrack corner to the block!  The pitch up to Sous le Toit is a bit inobvious - after a mantle move, clip a pin which hopefully has a long piece of tat on it, then look left about 15 feet for the pendulum point.  Do not get sucked up right along the beautiful flake to multiple bail slings.  Up higher, there are 3 spots on the route where it felt like C2: just before the pitch 27 (SuperTopo) anchor (which you should skip and continue to just below the roof); from the protection bolt to the belay on pitch 29 (just above the roof); and a short bit just below long ledge.  The pitch 34 ""5.9 squeeze and C1"" involved a short squeeze to good gear at the top of the chimney, then lowering out to good face holds outside the slot.  Then enjoy the beautiful low angle hand crack to the top of the route!  I linked pitches 34 and 35.  There's a horizontal crack at the top that takes good .4, .5, and .75 camalots.  Also there's a nice, flat, unprotected bivy near a tree directly above this final anchor.  Enjoy!  ","Moab, Utah",Yosemite Valley,106154042,5.9,intermediate,"Jun 2, 2009"

We linked Pitches 4-5 by being wise with long slings to reduce rope drag. We linked Pitches 6-8 into two pitches; this allowed us to have a more comfortable belay spot than the small stance at the top of the standard Pitch 6. We had a single 60m rope.  • From reading the comments, there is a wide range for how long it takes to do this route. Some parties get benighted. Some take 4 hours from base to top. We were somewhere in-between: we left the car at 6:45am and got back at about 6:45pm, for a 12 hour no-headlights car-to-car day; we never rushed and we took a lunch break en route to allow a speedy Swiss team to pass us.   • I'd say the route earns the ""+"" on the 5.9+.

Use this information in conjunction with the MP description, guidebooks, etc.  The following is current as of Sept 29, 2022.   Yes, the rating is a sandbag, but if you show up with the mindset that you could be asked to climb ~10b at any given time, you’ll probably do fine.  Pitch 3, 7, 8, and 12 (or 11 if you don’t break it up) felt like the cruxes.   RECOMMENDED RACK   Offset nuts, single BD 0.2, single black Totem if you’ve got it, double 0.3 - 3, single 4, optional 5.  We had a couple finger sized offset cams as well (0.2/0.3 and 0.3/0.4), and made good use of them.  We placed the 5 several times, and were happy to have carried it.  A few lightweight short draws, and lots of extendable alpine draws.  We used a single 60m rope.    APPROACH   Guidebook maps do a decent job of laying out the basics.  Park in the pullout on the south side of the loop road (Southside Drive), or, if you’re coming from the east, park on the small connector road near El Cap Meadow (El Capitan Drive) to avoid driving all the way around the loop, and walk 2 minutes to the pullout.   Head up the main trail from the center of the pullout, arriving at the Valley Loop Trail in about 1 minute.  Turn left, walk for another minute, and take your first right on an unsigned, but good, trail.  (If you parked on El Capitan Drive, there is a marginally faster way to get to this point - consult guidebook maps if you're interested.)   Eventually, ahead and left, you will see a large boulder with TONS of chalk on the holds.  The trail continues straight towards it, but look for a hard right turn a little bit before you get to the boulder (but within sight of it).  It’s a good trail, but has several downed trees across it currently, making it possible to miss.  Climb over the trees, there’s only a few of them.  Follow this good trail as it winds up the hill for quite a while, until you find yourself on the left side of a large talus slope.   Follow a heavily cairned route across to the right side of the talus slope, and uphill along the talus (more cairns) from there.  Eventually, the cairns lead you to a trail in the forest, on the right side of the talus, close to the cliffs.  This part is minimally cairned, but the trail isn’t too hard to follow.  This trail ultimately brings you back to the talus, where you ascend (lightly cairned) for a while longer.  Again, the cairns will lead you to a second trail in the forest, on the right side.  Somewhere visible near the edge of the talus may be the ideal place to rack up and leave your packs (it’d be hard to blow past this spot on the descent).   Wherever you leave your packs, pick some good landmarks (the Cathedral Spires work well, and can be seen somewhat in the dark if it’s clear out).  Consider the fact that you might be coming back in the dark - a GPS waypoint, or noting the elevation, could be good ideas.  Bring your headlamp on the route.   At this point, you’ll want to start eyeballing your approach to the base of Higher Cathedral Rock.  Once back in the forest, you'll see a small patch of open talus surrounded by trees.  From the right side of this talus patch, pick up (sometimes rougher) trails that lead a short distance to the base of the cliff.   Once you arrive at the cliff, you’ll need to head right a ways to find the base of the route.  Steph Abegg has a photo in the image gallery that shows exactly what you’re looking for.     PITCH 1   Climb up to the large ledge, and cut left to the other side of the big tree (fixed rappel tat on the tree, and a couple old bolts just beyond).  Follow precarious looking, but not actually that nasty, stacked blocks up until you find a big ledge, with a short section of more inspiring looking crack/corner climbing above.  Belay here.  Some sources cite a bolted station here, but all I saw was some tat around a natural feature (I think it was a pinch point).  It’s a pretty long pitch, and you could probably find a place for the #5, but it’s kinda too easy to care.   PITCH 2   MP description does a good job with this one.  If you have a #5, you’ll be stoked to place it 10-15 ft above the belay.  Keep going up, climbing kind of whatever, until you can make a move to the right towards a tree (welcome shade) and a pillar of rock (not actually that “weird”).   PITCH 3   First burly pitch of the route.  Really fun climbing, but I actually found it a little bit harder than the famed corner pitches in the upper half of the route - maybe I just bungled part of a sequence, or maybe it was the sun.  Regardless, it’s sweet.  I’m pretty sure I placed both the #4 and the #5 somewhere in the bottom half of the pitch.  As the climbing eases, continue up and left a little bit farther to a comfy ledge.   PITCH 4/5   Best linked.  Follow the left facing corner (it's not as steep as the MP description suggests), until you can traverse left on face holds at the approximate elevation of the ledge/flakes far to your left.  There’s no need to go up, and then back down, the final feature before the traverse.  You’ll pass a bolted belay, but do not stop here.  Keep traversing left, over the flakes, and build a gear belay beneath the obvious, huge, gray corner system.   PITCH 6   Super fun, and true to grade.  The guidebook shows a couple fixed pins down low, but none exist.  Even without them, the protection is good.  Belay at a mediocre stance, with some janky fixed gear (piton and nut equalized with a couple shitty cords, and a crammed 0.75 with nothing attached to it).  This is all easily backed up with gear, I think I used a 0.4.   To be continued...  ","Revelstoke, BC",Yosemite Valley,105862896,5.9+,intermediate,"Sep 30, 2022"

Awesome corner climbing and some wide stemming bring you to a steep bulge with a conveniently located bong to clip near the lip.  A few thuggy moves with mostly good holds get you through.  Climb on top of a small tree (#5 or slingable chockstone for pro).  The chimney / claustrophobic squeeze lay ahead, so this is a good place to clip your shoes or any other bullshit you have dangling from your harness for your second to collect.  I climbed the upper, narrow squeeze right side in, which I think made the exit the easiest.  Get right in there and squirm a few inches at a time, but stay just far enough out so that your helmet doesn’t get stuck inside.  Moving upward isn’t easy, but falling out would be even harder.  About 3 meters above the squeeze, you can build a bomber belay (#2, #3, #4) at a stance with a decent foot ledge.  This puts you in a convenient position to drop a loop down to your second to haul their pack, shoes, helmet, etc. through the chimney.   PITCH 8   Looks pretty chill, but the start has a few tough moves.  Once you’re out of sight of your belayer, you’ll head slightly right to climb a much easier chimney.  There’s an opportunity to place the #5, but it’s not super critical (this is the last time that I placed it on the route).  Belay on an obvious, comfortable ledge at the top of the chimney.  There’s an old bolt and a piton, as well as cracks to place additional gear.   PITCH 9   A relatively short and easy pitch, traversing to the left.  For the second half, you’ll be downclimbing.  Belay on a nice ledge, below the tree, at a stance that allows you to watch your parter well through the downclimbing bit.   PITCH 10   This is where you start to have several options.  One of the MP photos lays out your options well, and we took the “original/standard” route (yellow line), as it sounded the friendliest.  Basically, there are 2 large scale corner / wide crack systems above you to choose from.  We took the left one.  It’s a long pitch, tunnelling through a few trees, pulling on some questionable branches (with pro at your feet, and a ledge below you) at the very end.  Build a gear belay on top of the final tree, beneath a big chimney system.  Despite the trees, the rope drag isn't actually that bad.   PITCH 11   Head up the chimney, it’s pretty chill.  When presented with the option to break out left, take it.  Build a gear belay on a sloping ledge beneath a wide crack in a corner.   PITCH 12   Head up the obvious wide crack/corner (mostly fists).  It’s a bit burly at times.  Once you make it to the top of this thing, all of the hard climbing is over.  Plug a directional for your follower, bust a right, and follow easy ground up to the top of the cliff, where you can belay off of a tree (it’s a ways back, so consider extending your anchor to the lip).   DESCENT   Getting down is pretty easy, and well cairned.  You’ll have to go uphill at least a little bit at the start (even if you don’t want to tag the summit), and almost all of it is walking terrain.  As you drop below the col, there are a few steep-ish 3rd or 4th class downclimbing moves.  At times, you'll be scrambling over fallen trees and boulders, but none of it’s too bad.  Descend straight down for quite a ways, before eventually cutting back left to collect your packs.  If you find the giant talus field that you ascended on the approach, make sure not to go too far down the thing, or you might end up below your bags.

Harder with the wide section...it is definitely the toughest 10a I've ever done. I can't imagine climbing this route in 1964 with no climbing shoes, cams, nuts, or modern equipment. Frank Sacherer was pretty BA.   In the fall 2014 I jumped on this route with my friend Ryan C. I struggled up the 5.8 offwidth start, hung on a cam on the first fingers/lieback section, huffed and puffed up to the good rest stance before the wide hands section, almost completely ranout the wide hands section up to the chockstone because it's so fun and secure, placed a #4 below the chockstone and an offset nut between the chockstone and the wall, then took a 15 footer out of the OW above. I batmanned up to the chockstone and tried several other techniques trying to make progress up the wide crack. The inside of the crack is quite polished and it is difficult to get a good heel/toe to stick on the slick surfaces. I finally committed to stacking a couple fists, pulling up high, and wedging a secure knee in the crack. That's as far as I made it. I slipped down the crack a bit and my knee became painfully wedged in. I was stuck. 15 minutes later, after trying to free myself, I called down to my belayer and friends to call YOSAR. It was pretty humiliating and humbling. My belayer was running down to his truck to get a #6 cam in effort to help me pull myself out while my wife and friends ran down the trail to find cell phone reception in order to call search and rescue. While I was there alone, the anchor tied off below, I begged a prayer to God to help me get out of it. Soon after, I realized that part of the problem was that my right foot was also stuck, which prevented me from being able to shift my knee. I managed to get my shoe off and my foot was free. I stacked fists again above my head, pulled up hard and was able to wiggle my knee free and rest on the rope. When my wife and friends arrived they were relieved and called off the YOSAR team that was on the way. Afterward, everyone was over climbing anymore for the day and I escaped with my tail between my legs, a couple scabs on either side of my knee, and a lost offset nut and 'biner. God answers prayers, even when they are to rescue ourselves from the dumb decisions we make and situations we place ourselves in.   I recently came back to this route for round 2. My buddy Aaron S. floated the 5.8 OW approach pitch, handed me the sharp end, and it was my turn to slay the dragon. I liebacked up the thin crack start and almost peeled a couple times as my left foot smeared on the smooth face left of the line. One might also be able to jam this section using off-fingers jams, but the crack isn't straight in, it cuts into the wall at an angle from right to left, allowing a lieback to be used. I placed a finger sized cam and gunned it for a thin hand jam up high. I made it through the lower section using this strategy of placing gear from the occasional pod hand jam and fighting to the next one. Eventually the crack allowed for solid hand jams up to a good rest ledge. I took a breather there, and asked Aaron S. to tag me up his number 6 (4.5""-7.5"" cam), #3 big bro, and Valley Giant #9 (6""-9"" cam). I hung these on a shouldered sling and left all the other cams and gear I wouldn't need hanging from a cam near the ledge. I then struggled up the off-hands crack, placing and bumping a couple number 3s (wide hand sized cams) along the way, all the while fighting the giant, unwieldy cams that kept swinging in front of me on the shoulder sling. I must have been pretty tired from our attempts on the Steck Salathe and Gold Wall's Silent Line the two days before, because this section felt much harder than it had before. Approaching the chockstone and horizontal crack that mark the beginning of the real fight up the offwidth, I slapped in a #4 (fist sized cam) and clipped the couple bail slings that were already around the chockstone. I then climbed up to a stance atop the chockstone and horizontal crack for a respite before the fight. Reaching high, I placed the #6 deep into the crevice and started offwidthing right side in. I was able to effectively use the knee lock this time for a couple feet which provided a good upper body rest during the start. Fortunately, the number 6 bumped adequately until about 2/3 up the OW where it settled into a tipped-out but secure position. Gasping for breath and sweating away my friction, I planted the Giant up high in the last bit of the wide and thrashed my way up, almost within reach of the exit jug on the left. I wanted so bad to just grab the cam and make the pain go away, but decided to risk the fall and the skin as I was continually slipping back down against the hard won inches whenever I let up on my body tension or breath. Man did it feel good to finally get that jug in hand. As I mantled up to victory my left foot suddenly skated off the smooth left face, as if to say, ""It's not over yet!"" Thankfully, I held on, and stood up to clip the chains. Yesssss. Hardest fought 10a of my life...so far. It's 6 days later and my scraped up right shoulder, right knee, and shins are still getting the Neosporin treatment.   Thank you to Wendy, Ryan, Rudi, Kristina, Aaron, and YOSAR for putting up with my shenanigans on this one.   Needless to say, my offwidth and wide climbing experience and technique is limited, so be ready for a fight if you're not dialed on 5.9 offwidth.  It is possible to do most of the route up to the chockstone (which is outstanding) and bail safely from it below the wide section on this route. There may be slings for bailing already in place, but bring your own along with a quicklink just in case.      Cleaning the Valley Giant #9 on rappel. Cam & photo credit to Aaron Stireman.

My partner took the lead first, and took a small ground fall (his first in the years we've been climbing) on the initial off width section. He had one older camalot #3 placed and had bounce tested it a few times, but must have messed it up it going by because he slipped off just past the piece and it popped out on his way to the ground. I was spotting close and the fall didn't hurt, so he wanted to continue, but much more cautiously.    His head game was not good after the fall, and while there are no crux moves on the crack the climbing is very sustained so he was calling for a lot of takes and really sewing it up. Eventually he made the infamous ""5.8 off width"" at the top, and after going up and backing down a few times finally decided he wasn't feeling good about it.   Now it was my turn to try to slay the demon, and while I wasn't really looking forward to it, I was anxious to actually do some climbing after a long and tedious belay. The initial off width section was pretty easy on top rope, but I was surprised by how physical the lieback and fist jamming above was. None of the moves are harder than 5.10, but the sum is greater than the parts.   When I finally got up to the last horizontal before the chockstone, sweating and cursing, I pulled up to it on a sketchy nut my partner had wedged into the chock stone and started digging the dirt out from behind it with my nut tool. Eventually I was able to get a sling around it, and my last excuse for hanging on the end of the rope was gone. It was time to try to try to climb this thing.   I immediately discovered how awkward it is to get into the off width section. Nothing really felt tight enough to stick a fist in, and I couldn't get enough of my body inside to balance on the chock stone. I tried twisting my foot into the slippery walls and squirming up, but every time I would come right back down more tired than before. Finally, I decided it was my helmet that was the problem keeping me from getting deep enough in to balance, so I took it off and stuck it into the crack. To my surprise, it was the perfect size to jam in the 6"" section and felt like it might allow me to aid my way up to the chains, if it didn't explode first.    Desperate now, I slammed my fist on top of my hapless Vapor helmet (RIP) until it was at knee height. Then, I mustered up the last of my strength to mantel up and stand on top of it and wiggle the last 2 feet until the jug at the top that allows access to the chains. Once we were back on the ground and I pulled what was left of my helmet out of the crack, we decided to lick our wounds and go climb something easier.    As if my day wasn't already strange enough, as I was walking down towards Pine Line for a consolation prize, I suddenly bumped into Alex Honnold walking down the same trail as me. I was too exhausted and new to Yosemite climbing to hazard a guess if this was an unusual occurance or not, so we just walked down the trail for a few minutes while I relayed my harrowing tale of fighting for my life on my first valley off-width. He said he was just rappelling down from the top of El Cap and ""working on some stuff,"" but I was too tired to even try to put that in context with the struggles of an ordinary gumby on his first trip to Yosemite.    If you are a great crack climber or even a good one, you might not think this route is very hard-but for everyone else, you'll have your work cut out for you!

Done this way, I honestly felt this was one of the easier sections of climbing on the entire route. My partner didn't agree, but she kept the pack on and climbed it straight in.   And then there's the squeeze in the Supertopo Pitch 5. Easily the worst two feet of progress I've ever attempted to make. Mind-blowingly frustrating. None of the ""classic 5.9+"" offwidths I've climbed even remotely compare to this completely innocuous-looking slot for utter futility and pain.    Oh, yeah, my helmet decided to detach from my harness in this section. With my headlamp attached. Did I mention it was mid-October with sunset a little after 6p?   P4 (ST 6) I had carried the belay too high up and left in my glee to have escaped from the aforementioned squeeze, and my partner did a great job of extracting us, including a heady 5.9+ slab step right off the belay and a .10a-b traverse right under a roof later in the pitch. Surprisingly full-value pitch.   P5 (ST 7) There are crack systems everywhere. I think we went one system too far to the right --- it was grainy, surprisingly loose, and consistently strenuous 5.9. More reminiscent of an infrequently traveled alpine route than a Valley classic.    The good news about creative routefinding on these two pitches was that the upper pitches proved manageable in comparison!   P6 (ST 9) Beautiful, steep, sometimes fisty.

One crappy old bolt, a few nice new ones. Thin but all there.   P8 (ST 11-12) Mega-lead by my partner. She climbed the Narrows about as quickly as most people climb 5.9 face. Be sure to exit the Narrows after ~60 feet, though, not attempt to tunnel all the way to the belay. If you stay deep, you'll probably get stuck --- my partner tried and had to downclimb (downslither?). Good climbing through this entire pitch, and well-featured (even in the Narrows).

The first pitch is wide and has a slung chockstone you can see from the base ledge.  From here, with the supertopo topo, we didn't have any other route finding issues even on the descent.   This route is time consuming with many memorable pitches.  The Wilson overhang has excellent gear on the left wall the whole way if you elect to climb it on the outside.  We skipped the squeeze on the next pitch in favor of the 5.8 flake.  Partner led this pitch, there is gear and placing a piece high in the squeeze seemed to help.  Kind of barn doory to get into the flake.     After the bivy ledge the route gets harder and more sustained.  The 5.9 face pitch was amazing, plenty of gear on it really.  Safe if you dont run out of draws like I did and completely miss a bolt staring me in the face.  Long draws are essential as this pitch wanders a bit.  The .10b flare was strenuous, but fun (to follow).     The narrows, what a classic adventure pitch.  Dont go wrong side in (like I did) it makes an already hard pitch waaay harder.  I came flying out after a ten minute struggle, changed directions and was able to get up into the slot with alot less thrutching.  Once you are in, it is not over.  It is helpful to change directions again once standing on the jug midway up.  I figured this out after about an hour long epic struggle cumulating with a slither down the slot to the foot jug.  Knowing what I know now, this pitch will probably feel much more reasonable in the future.  As for which direction to start, ill leave that up to the reader to figure out.  The meat of the narrowd protects well with a 4 or 5 at the start.  I got a finger size piece in higher up and rps in a small crack on the wall in the middle.   The narrows worked me and I belayed just after the squeeze as I was taking wayy too long.  My partner graciously led the second half of the pitch and while easier, it seemed quite scary.   The last few pitches were non-trivial though easier.     We descended in the dark and with all of the excellent information here it was quite manegable though time consuming.  The initial gulley (part 1) is very long and descends almost the entire length of the face.  We opted for a rappel off a tree halfway down.

After finishing the last pitch you will arrive at the top of The Sentinel from here continue along the ridge towards Glacier Point which is East.  From there you will pick up some Carins.  This will lead you to a point where it looks like you could either go west towards El Cap or East towards Glacier Point.  Keep heading east,  right after turning left you will wiggle between two blocks and pick up and obvious trail.  After following the trail you will get to a gully with a prominent wall that will force you to continue right towards El Cap.  Downclimb some easy 3rd class till you reach this wall and cut back left towards Glacier Point into the main gulley which you will follow all the way until you the reach the stream.  If you keep going right towards El Cap you will most likely die.  I took a nasty slide down a sandy slab before catching a manzanita bush.  Once in the main descent gulley keep following the trail until you come to point where the gully splits off into two plausible options.  You want to stay on the skiers left of the gulley.  If you go right on the more open slabby side you'll get cliffed out.  Once you turn left you will start heading town a slightly loose dirt and pine duff trail, till you come to point where there is rappel tree on skiers right or a low fifth-class down climb on the left.  Either option works it's your call.  After navigating that section continue down the gulley aiming for the stream at the bottom.  Once you hit the stream follow the easiest path to cross the stream until you are in the middle of the gulley that leads down to the valley floor.  Head down the open slab with streams on either side of you.  Eventually you will come to a point where it looks you can't go any further.  Once you reach this point there should be a carin.  Head skiers left towards a block with old rappel tat on it.  Don't rappel off this,  instead work you way down and right towards a small gulley canopied by live oaks and manzanitas.  This gulley will put you onto some more 3rd class slab downclimbing.  Keep heading down and left towards the stream you crossed when you first entered this gulley.  Eventually you will come to point with a bunch of trees and the stream on your left.  Follow the stream through trees until you get fairlly close the the base of Sentinel.  You will cross over a log and cut hard left back towards the the 3rd class mossy ramp on the approach.  You will quickly pick up a distinct trail leading back to the approach trail.

The two times I climbed the Sentinel, once in July and once in September, there was no water at all.    Personally I would recommend folks not try to create, or needlessly memorize, detailed descent descriptions that spend paragraphs explaining how to get through hiking / third and four class terrain. Trust yourself that you will find the best way - heck if you are doing the Sentinel descent you just climbed a burly route, so a little bushwhacking, low fifth class downclimbing, etc. should not be too much to worry about. Worry about making it to the pizza deck before it closes!......lol, that will make you try way harder to find the right way, and will keep you from endlessly looking for a set of bushes or trees that matches some wordy, dubious descent description.   I updated the topo with this descent beta: (both times I climbed the Sentinel we got back to the Four Mile Trail in under an hour).   Steep, technical and loose, do not  attempt the first half of the descent  in the dark. Hike / scramble  south to  enter the steep gully that drops away  to the east (toward Half Dome).  Negotiate this steep gully with some  low fifth class downclimbing, or rappeling,  in spots. The gully ends on slabs which   lead you around the mountain (stay  skier’s right) and into forrested trail  and short downclimbing sections that  lead back to the Four Mile Trail.

They were simul-rapping, with a hard diagonal to the right, attempting to reach the top of Serenity Crack (the anchor just above the 5.10d).  One of them, who was not wearing shoes, was down in the gulley and nearing the anchor, suddenly slipped.  He rocketed across the face and whipped out of sight, landing in trees and banging his hip hard on the rock below.  He took probably a 100 foot swing and hit hard.  His partner then decided to take the same swing to get to his hurting partner.  I yelled to them and they said they were OK.  They descended from trees and other anchors to the ground.    This scenario seems like it could happen to others.  In fact, Supertopo warns of it on their topo.  The solution for me is to make a few short single rope raps, while diagonaling right, to avoid the big swing.  Be careful out there.  ",,Yosemite Valley,105862915,5.10-,intermediate,"Jun 28, 2009"

Serenity crack was originally ""bench mark"" 5.11 when first freed (by guys with thick fingers and kletter shoes) but settled down to 5.10d when that was finally established with EBs (the first friction style slippers) and clean pro that is yes, easier to place than pitons on lead. Over time things change as well due to a normal cycle of rock getting better in the short term (generally cleaner, better beta, loose micro flakes and lichen wear away etc) and then get worse in the long term (holds get polished, chalk caked etc).    The varying opinions on ratings for Sons reflect that. The second pitch is clearly 5.10a if you have larger hands/fingers and know the beta for the OW bypass (lieback to a balancy high step. save a 1"" tcu for a perfect placement in a splitter out left once you get established on the knobs),and use stems for rests etc. Your one 4"" Friend can also be used to protect this section too as well as the top pitch and is worth having, imo. If you think this pitch is 10B go do Gripper, Midterm or (*shudder*) Ahab and re-assess. As posted above if you have thin fingers and uber sticky slippers Serenity is as light a 10d as there is in the Valley. Your mileage will vary on other size cracks higher on the route particularly when your feet are not as happy in those same gym slippers or you are finding insecure jams.   The last pitch has new Beta (walk the plank). When first done it was only envisioned as straight forward thin hands with your feet on the slab. Now that the feet are even better on the slab (lichen/flakes cleaned up) the thin hands at this moderate grade (5.10a) is to be enjoyed. Plus, anyone making it this far should not have a problem. But climb it however you please of course and pass your stoke to others.    Go for the top as the supposed ""runout"" to the bolt is trivial friction and the route is complete when linked to Awahnee Buttress (technically it is an easier variation to this route). The old bad bolt that was there has been replaced and it is perfectly safe. However bring a shovel if you go for the rim via AB or maybe someone will further clean out other perfect cracks up there (Xanadu, 5.8) that would make the finish to the top truly brilliant and a great approach to Crest Jewel.    best   ps Please go for the top of SoY up the easy slab and use the new rap route to the east that starts from the last ledge (pine tree now gone but there are separate bolted anchors all the way to the base of Serenity only needing a 60m rope) to avoid congestion at the trees and resulting damage.

This station on Sunset Ledge sends you down MoF completely separate from all parties on Serenity and would also serve as an excellent rap route from Serenity as well to avoid the cluster. It starts on the lip of Sunset Ledge above and to the east of Serenity (clearly visible and safely reachable) and then has a short first rappel to a good stance, uses an established anchor on MoF, then uses a Pigs in Space anchor, then another new anchor on a dike/ramp to get you to the top of the first pitch anchor of Maxine's Wall/Firefingers and from there to the ground.

But even if you come from a position of wanting to cater to beginners, isn't part of becoming a multi-pitch, traditional climber learning how to deal with unforeseen problems and complications - even if retreat becomes necessary? As much as I've hated the times when I've gotten in over my head and have had to retreat, in retrospect, those times not only taught me a lot but moreover really built up my confidence as a climber.    Learning what it feels like to be some combination of being too slow, unprepared, tired, injured, lost, hungry, uncomfortable, unlucky, or terrified is a really important experience to have. Are people really having to bail frequently from the first half of Royal Arches? If so I can't really think of a better route to have that experience on. It's moderate, featured, well-traveled, and sits immediately next to civilization in a practically climate-controlled Valley near some of the best help available if things get really out of hand.

Josh Janes suggests that this is a very historical route and people have done it for years without such bolts and the climb is close to civilization of help is needed.  The argument opposing this is that over the last 10 years, most of the trees on the route have been dying or in a severe state of decline.  Climbers for generations have been using these trees as rap anchors which have greatly contributed to the death of these trees.  In our striving to climb clean we neglected to preserve the trees.  Certainly a few well placed bolts as anchors on the lower sections are nowhere near as odious as the track of bolts on what has become the rappel route.  I presume that someone who doesn't like a rap route on the lower pitches wouldn't lower themselves to using the normal rappel route.  Having bolts for anchors at selected locations is a good thing to protect the trees and promote climber safety.  ","Santa Rosa, CA",Yosemite Valley,105862881,5.10a/b,intermediate,"Nov 12, 2019"

Scroll the photos to find it, should be easy to follow. Below are the three ways to rap, in ascending order of value.      1) single 60m, either reg or simul rapping. If competent and experienced, simul is fine, otherwise the more experienced goes first to establish the line.     2) 80m, reg or simul. Simul will help, as you will have 4 double station raps w/ an 80. I need to do a topo for this as well, sorry for lagging.     3) IMO the best way, use a 70m on route, and carry a 70 tag (6-7mm) in the pack. I carry a 7.1, 70mm 1/2 rope for this, fits fine in a 25L pack. This results in 4 raps to the huge ledge that leads to the tree/gully walkdown. These will be triple station raps (you will bypass TWO stations) for the first two raps, then double station, then triple station. The 4th rap will get off on a pedestal to climbers R, requiring a 10m downclimb of 5.1 terrain, with no danger factor (unless you walked from station 9-10, then you don't have to do this downclimb- see topo). Untie your ropes here. After walking down the tree gully to the station above P2, do a couple raps (or one, if no water in the P2 gully) to the start of P2.   Now repeat the walk from the chimney (or alt start), in reverse. At the intersection near the bottom, turn perpendicular to the wall and follow the sandy path towards the Alt start. go 25ft from the wall, turn R, walk 10ft, and there is a bomber rap station, which is basically in the middle of a straight line between the top of the chimney, and the top of the Alt start. Do a single rope rap from here (trend climbers L if using a 60m, otherwise 70 is easily on the ground), coil rope, walk back to car.    do NOT use 2x 60m ropes, this is a waste of time, IMO. If all are competent, the raps will take 1:00-1:30. If not, potentially 2:00-2.5hrs. If traffic, potentially 4-5hrs. Plan your start time and/or day you climb accordingly. Enjoy.   addendum: if using double 70m. carry one rope on your non-dominant arm and allow it to spool off as you lead the raps. First two are always fine but I find that the ropes tend to twist around each other by the 3rd/4th rap. Dumping one strand and holding the other will be faster in the long run when you do NOT have to deal with a fustercluck of ropes twisting around each other. First two raps are to be threaded w/ knot on L. 3rd rap should be threaded w/ knot on R, and 4th should be knot on L again.  ",Morro Bay,Yosemite Valley,105862881,5.10a/b,intermediate,"Apr 13, 2021"

On p4 we also took the right variation with the sweet hand crack.  p6+7: the money pitch! The upper half of p6 is an excellent hand crack that turns into a double hand crack for incredible fun. Linked with p7 up to the base of the OW for a rope-stretcher of a pitch.  p8: Heel-toe walked up the OW. The flakes above are a fun jug haul, though I was careful with weighting the large hollow sounding flake.  p10: 5.4 traverse. Most of this pitch was wet. I placed gear in cracks covered by sheets of running water, made for a hilariously unique and adventurous-feeling pitch. The (dry treated) rope got totally soaked. Still easy enough climbing to get across without issue, and the rope was surprisingly dry again by the end of the next pitch.  p11+12: linked. Took the 5.7 steep hands variation on p12. The last few moves before the tree on p11 combined with the steep hands on p12 distinctly felt like the hardest moves on the route to me, but maybe the latter is just because I had quite a bit of rope drag after the move out left. Passing the p11 tree on the left instead of the right would help to reduce drag if linking.   Erik Sloan's rappel route beta came in handy, though I think some of the rap lengths are a bit off. The only routefinding part that wasn't super straightforward to me was finding the 13th rap station after scrambling down the gully. We eventually found it, but I wouldn't recommend trying to find those bolts unroped, especially in the dark.

Awesome view from the top, and if you are trying to recreate the Supertopo shot, set your anchor on the optional belay halfway up the 11th pitch.

The top anchors can be reached by a fun 5.9 variation around the corner to the right that is worth doing in its own right (I'd give it 2-3 stars). Bring pro through #4 BD C4 and be prepared for some sustained & steep jamming, with occasional surprise stems to keep things reasonably easy. There is a little loose rock that is easy to avoid, and a fun lieback on a hollow flake (1-2 #2 C4s) that transitions to a bear hug & mantle to finish.   The second 5.8 pitch above Stone Groove is a LOT harder than the 5.9 approach pitch and it is not hands (well maybe the first part is). It is a very tight & flaring squeeze chimney that takes good elbows-up chikenwinging. There is no pro except for sliding a #6 BD C4 until you reach the chockstone near the top (takes a #1 BD C4?). If you have good flexibility you can reach around and place a small cam in a dirty seam behind you to backup the #6, though it might not hold much of a fall. The #6 is barely large enough to protect as it is slid along or re-set beyond the wider parts. The crux is getting through where the chimney widens just before the chockstone. This pitch was short but burly and very worth doing! (3 stars) Bring minimal pro, as gear definitely gets in the way leading this pitch.   Rap anchors for the 5.8 P2 are old and need replacing. We added some new webbing to tie elements together and added a rappel ring.

Moral of the story: bring a lightweight rain jacket with a hood on long routes like this, it might save your life.   Either CJ or CJD linked with Royal Arches makes for a lovely day out.  Neither one is going to involve a 'running belay', which is the norm for 'R'-rated slabs such as the ones mentioned at Stone Mountain (or, for that matter, many slab pitches nearby in Tuolumne and the Needles).

RR had just arrived for a quick trip with Jeff and his idea for an outing with the four of us, was Rawl Drive on Lembert Dome Appropriately the only real pitch followed a line of widely spaced bolts up the handsome west face of Lembert, after negotiating a rib lower down after the first belay. With RR leading off over the horizon in fabulous blue skies, and Jeff then also disappearing, Bridwell and I, being the youngsters of the group and certainly the self-styled bad boys, were left alone briefly to hone our skills of abject ridicule. You see, by this point, August 1971, we both knew RR and Jeff were just grand old men and had had to give up their reins to us squirts who certainly would know how to finally kick the horse in the flanks.    So toward this end, Bridwell performs, entirely for my benefit at our smidgeon of belay spot, and realize, very close at hand since he was tied to Jeffs trailing line and anchored at our belay, a hilarious mocking of RRs showboating style of face climbing. Lots of stepthroughs with uncanny hops, operated at a frequency far beyond what RR had performed but indicative of the wasteful and exhibitionistic quality they had had, say maybe ten stepthrough hops within 25 seconds, reminiscent of Irish clog dancing. He went on to add for me, several very alert memorable and classic RR facial profiles requiring he also flare the hell out of his nostrils and do RR eyes, as if to signify that in the beautiful alpine scene below us he as RR had sensed the Larger Picture from our aerie. As he actually began to follow the pitch, he continued this comedic routine with other Stony Point maneuvers, with lots of complicated back stepping, and a pronounced butt-outward posture to technically diminish the effect of the rocks angle and add the last possible bits of fun to our skit. We had seen it all, and now we were having fun. It was one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed Bridwell do. It was somewhat born of affection for Royal but it also was to call a spade a shovel, I have to think. Anyway our shenanigans ended, RR never knew and thus would never be hurt by it and there went a couple of hours in the Meadows.    But Jim and I werent done. We salvaged what was left of our productive day and roared back down to the Cookie area 50 miles away leaving the old farts with their memories, rappelled the soon-to-be Wheat Thin, and checked out this phenomenal formation. We were roped on and over the edge within an hour and half of leaving the Meadows.    Wheat Thin, on the Nabisco Wall, was not thought of as something a climber from Good Society would have bothered with. The silly thing is about 1 thick mostly, a flake so thin that in its expanse has many actual weathered through-and-through holes in its face as it stands mostly detached about 100 ft high above the actual Cookie top. And when I had been over in this area climbing, I of course had seen it, as everyone else had, and it did not even occur to me that it was a possible climb. What it looked like was mere ugliness and non-being---Nonclimbing, really, which can fill many climbing areas, especially 35 years ago.    But Bridwell, in his March to the Sea, had noticed it and had decided we were going to make this thing happen somehow, so that other climbers could not have it. Kind of how Richard Pryor says, Women, theyre weird, they buy shoes so that other women cant have them. And so over we go, bolts and hangers at the ready, and place a few really ugly, hideously protruding 1/4 compression units in the vertical cliff wall just to the left of this piece of granite paper shuddering on the wall, while taking out a few razor-edged flakes staked in the crack here and there. Bridwell did most of this as I hung out above him.    I am looking at him, he is wonderfully garbed in his all-white full-sleeved shirt and pants, but he is not happy. He is hammering away at the drill, but way fast, and doesnt seem to be enjoying anything anymore. We had been having such fun. The drill in those days was not carbide and would narrow out and bind quickly. The bolts are bottoming out too soon. I dont know. With him it could be anything. But eventually he clues me in. And then I see some blood, its near his crotch, lets me know his hemorrhoids are killing him. And he is in white.    So in the spirit of our raucous day that had begun in the Meadows, I take a motherly tone with him hanging 50 feet below me, trying to soothe him, advising my daughter about how this kind of thing happens to young ladies around this age, that it would become a regular thing, and that he should not be afraid it is just the weeping of the disappointed uterus. And he enjoys this new riff, jugs up, and I finished the last messed up bolt and we are out of there. So in a matter of an afternoon, Wheat Thin became the first rap-bolted climb in the Valley, only because it was such a fragile wildly expanding structure, and ironically authored by extreme trad climbers.    We instantly went back the next day I recall, and started to climb our monstrosity. Since it was Jims idea, as we stand on top of the Cookie, he leads off way to the right on a flake ledge to access the incipient crack that runs up to the actual defined left facing 1-4 thick lieback flake. He has hammered the sh#t out of a Long Dong trying to get it into the meager bottoming crack; there is nothing between him and I besides this and he tries to develop the moves above this A3-quality placement to reach our fancy flake.    He hates it; the situation is unexpected because the day before we had just looked at the flake higher up and not how to get into it. After about 30 minutes he actually backs off, gives me the lead. I am sure he was not at par either with his hemorrhoids. My advantage of course was that I did not drive the one and only point of protection between us, so I did not understand how it probably would not have held a real fall. I beat it a little, didnt love it but went ahead anyway. So bold and ignorant, I established these fairly hard 5.10c barn-door moves to the flake, thinking that they were gross, inconvenient, and just in the way of our special-assed flake rather than the actual beef of the whole route. Climbing onwards to the top of Butterballs for the belay, I encountered nothing as difficult as this technical start I had just done and had actually kind of gotten bored tippy-toeing around this dangerous thin feature for a hundred feet. Jim swarmed up the route, and we were off.    It turned out during subsequent ascents years later, a couple serious falls took place at the beginning, and that although it was to become a unique airy three-star route, the thing was nobodys little plaything. It was just put up by clowns.   ",,Yosemite Valley,105871252,5.10c,intermediate,"Oct 9, 2006"

One of the rap anchors consisted of two rusted bolts that wiggled like loose teeth, and the hangers on both bolts were smashed completely flat from rockfall, so it was impossible to replace the somewhat worn looking webbing connecting them together.  Fortunately there was a third bolt that looked good, but was missing a hanger.  We were able to cinch a wired stopper over this bolt and equalize this to the other sketchy anchor, which made me feel a little better on rappel.

The Supertopo says that it's hard to bail after the P4 station because of the traverses. I would like to report otherwise. We had 2x60m ropes, and were able to bail down fine doing P7+6 in one rap from the piton (new and shiny, looked really solid, backed up for the first climber, but leaving gear might be a good idea), then a slight diagonal across pitch 5 from bolts, and from there P4+3 and P2+1 rap easily from bolts down to the ground. Total gear left: 1 locking caribiner on the piton at the top of P7.   A french party behind us also bailed off the 10c variation about 20 minutes before us, leaving a gear anchor somewhere before the traverse over to the 50 crowded variation before joining into the bolted rap stations.

The Regular Route is perhaps the most enjoyable (5.9 move + A0 or 5.10c), and the 50 Crowded Var. is a little tricky & thin (small cams & extend), plus a bit run-out through the 5.6/5.7 face above.  Good climbing though.   A couple notes to augment the SuperTopo.  It is worth trying to skip the belay at the top of P7 - it takes pretty small gear to back up the pin there, and is a small stance.  You can reach top of P8 with a 70m, or there is a good belay just about 30 feet above the top of P6 belay, then you can reach w/ 60m.    Lastly, the left hand 5.10a to 5.9 variation at the top of the route, exiting the 5.7 groove on the left, I found to be really enjoyable and maybe some of the better climbing on the route.  I'm lost with the grades though - I would describe this section as a 5.8 move into the finger crack out of the groove and climb up past a flake to the tree, then above to a 5.8 move steeping left (5.10a in SuperTopo), then up the right leaning crack - a 5.7 layback (5.9 hand traverse in SuperTopo? - seems easy).

Magical and otherworldly, though - auditory experience in there is 10/10 with echoes and dripping water.  - We saw a party working a route top-down between the EB topout and the start of the gulley, so it could be that there will be another descent option at some point.   Closing thought: If you liked this route, you will absolutely love the Ho Chi Minh. Harder and more committing, not a good route to push grades on imo, but my feeling is that the HCMT is substantially better than the EB and more classic in every respect. And I liked the EB!

Might not beat the folks using the rap route back to the car, but it made for an adventurous day. I found the distance descriptions in Supertopo to feel a bit off, but the play by play was fairly accurate. I think the most crucial beta if you go this way is you will literally be right near the back / beginning of the gully between higher and middle cathedral - the first fifty yards or so into the gully are mellow and walkable until you encounter the obvious first rap.

Maybe they all knew something about the air that we didn't - oh well.  A few notes:   1.  We linked 1 & 2, then 3 & 4 with a 60, then climbed the crux bolted pitch (almost made it clean!  There's a few tricky moves).    2.  We headed right to the 50 crowded after the bolted pitch.  It's a little runout there to a pin, then delicate edgy climbing with small gear here and there over to the start of P7.   It wasn't terrible but a fall on most of this traverse pitch would pendulum pretty far or pull out crummy gear.  Gotta just be careful and keep going.  3.  Maybe I was just pumped when I got to P10, but I thought about 30 feet leading up to the first tree with rap rings (end of this pitch) was super hard and runout.  Maybe I went the wrong way - face climbing with almost no gear and small nubs for hands and feet.  Seemed in the 10's with almost no gear until a crack 30' or more up.  I felt like I basically soloed this part.  Curious if anyone else went this way.   Decent Beta:  We ended up doing the ""walk off"" because after over an hour of searching we never found the first set of rap rings that are apparently 20' left and 6' down from the tree with slings.  That would have been nice...   For the decent you climb to the second ledge with a tree with slings, this one was the one full of ants.  This is the first point where you can see yourself potentially unroping and scrambling (we belayed).  You then head up the gully to climber's right.  Eventually you come to a 20' or so rock blocking the gully and have to climb over it, stand on top, then climb DOWN the other side.  You should now be at a point where the wall is on your left and you walk around a path to your left.  There is a tree here you can belay from if you are still roped up.  We belayed this last pitch.  Look down from the tree and a little to the left and you will see a cairn of sorts.  This marks the start of the decent (starts 10-15 feet below and left of the tree), but you still have to go up around 50-70 feet once you get to this lower path.  Get down to this path the easiest way then eventually come to about a 45 degree incline.  Trees, a little scrambling and climbing, will get you to the top of this.  Now you can see slabs (lots of pebbles and such on them) in front of you.  Across the slabs, straight and a little down, are more cairns.  Get across here CAREFULLY (we roped up).  Now you are on more of a trail that you just have to follow cairns and mostly stay in the brush away from the edge all the way around to the massive gully.  You will know when you get there, it's a dead end with nowhere else to go but down.  The first set of rap anchors are NOT on climber's right.  The gully kind of has two gullys at the top that combine into one 50 or so feet lower down.  The first set of rap anchors is on climber's LEFT of these paths.  When hiking down the top of the gully (looking down) go all the way to the RIGHT side, then start looking on your left.  There was only one bolt, the other had been smashed off by a rock.  I added a #5 nut and sling to the anchor.  The next anchor is the chock stone 90' further down.  You reach this with a 60.  I added a sling and biner to the pile of old brittle webbing.     I felt the decent was more adventurous than the climb itself and took us forever.  The climb was 5 stars all day long but to echo other climbers here I would opt for the rap route if I would have found it.

Felt harder and some slick feet after the roof. Good warmup for the route. Nice big ledge for the belay. Care full midway up the 1st pitch below roof, a LOT of lose blocks/rocks, climb gingerly through here.   Link 3/4: Moves look scarier than it is passing the 2 pitons, but holds are jugs and movement easily up considerably after the ""loose flakes."" Make sure you extend your pieces around the ""loose flakes"" to prevent rope drag for the rest of the long link up. Crack system wanders right than back left.   We didn't link pitch 5 and 6 because of it seemed to wander to much. My buddy aided most of the bolted section. We suck at slab. For the leader, after the last bolt, try to place your next piece as high as possible, consider bumping or back cleaning for follower. After I unclipped the last bolt I had a swing/pendulum to the left since route and the next piece was pretty far left.    pitch 6: As per fish topo and other topos, it shows first piton pretty up and far right of the belay. Piton is more towards above the anchors on the right side of the ledge. There's two bolted anchors for pitch 6. No need for any big gear here. Mostly finger size to C3 size cams to protect your follower during the traverse.   Link pitch 7/8 (pitch 4 of Fish topo). Bring all the slings you have. We had 12 or 13 slings on us and I wished I had 1-2 more even after running it out on parts of the routes. I would definitely recommend simul climbing about 30ft so you can get to the next big ledge to belay on. The top of pitch 7 is a little ledge and seems very uncomfortable as well as other anchor set up near the top of pitch 8. The first part of pitch 7 is pretty mellow so leader shouldn't be to scared of being pulled down. I didn't see this part of the topo or else I would've brought by micro traxion. I used a #2, .75 and .4 for my anchor.   link 9/10: pretty straight forward. Climb to the huge ledge to where the bolted anchors are to climbers far left for the rappel. I've included some photos so show were the rap stations are.

The first two rap stations are obvious and easy to find. The third rap station was rather tricky for me to spot, so I wanted to call it out to hopefully save a few folks a little bit of time: when rappelling from the second station, descend about 20 meters, you'll arrive at a ledge with a small tree (it's a fairly obvious stopping point), when standing on the ledge, look up and climbers left around a slight corner, and the third rap station is just around this corner, about 10 feet above the base of the tree. From there, you descend down into the gully and the stations are all very obvious. A few of the raps are rather short, but I would only recommend linking raps if you have a tagline or are using an 80m rope. I don't think linking any of the raps would be possible with a 70m.   All told the raps took us about 2.5 hours, and that was with the tree raps, some gratuitous rope management, a single 70m, and searching for the third rap station.

I also agree that this is a great lead for anyone looking to push into the grade.  Used to be rated .10d and since downrated, I heard.  Much easier than other .10c lines like Lunatic Fringe and P1 Bombs Over Tokyo, and probably even Sacherer Cracker.  Might be on par with first pitch of Salathé.

See the overlay image on the Supertopo site (not yet resized for posting here), but now instead of going to the ledge with the dying tree that gets you to the top of Serenity Crack there is another station to the right that allows a short rappel to the next station right above Mother of the Future (crack line to the East of Serenity crack) on Sunset Ledge.    This station on eastern Sunset Ledge sends you down MoF completely separate from all parties on Serenity and serves as an excellent rap route from that route as well to avoid the cluster. It starts on the lip of Sunset Ledge above and east of Serenity (clearly visible and safely reachable) and then has a short first rappel to a good stance, uses an established anchor on MoF, then uses a Pigs in Space/Firefingers anchor, then another new anchor on a dike/ramp and then to the top of the first pitch anchor of Maxine's Wall/Firefingers and from there to the ground.    All are done easily with one 60m rope or in 3 rappels with two ropes. It will save some wear and tear on the trees, rapping on top of other parties on SoY and Serenity and you only need one 60M for the entire Serenity/Sons day.   Biggest thanks to Clint Cummins for most of the effort on this project.   supertopo.com/rock-climbing…   ps. Beware the ""sucker"" anchor on Daughters Direct (look at the overlay linked closely) as going to this anchor with one 60m rope will lead to an epic.

So useless in fact that he had to untie the rope from my harness once I reached the belay, lol (his partner showed up in the interim so he had to free the rope up in order to throw the rope down to him)! Their original plan was to do Butterballs above, so I sat there, tied off atop Beverly's Tower to decompress while his partner lead the next pitch. I was in no condition, nor with the experience to be following on this next section so I was lowered to get back to terra firma.   The lowering was uneventful until the last fifteen feet or so. With 45 meter (150') ropes the norm back then this proposed a problem. I dangled there for a bit, while something was arranged above (I didn't want to know).

The first seven pitches of this climb are superb.  After that, the route becomes somewhat discontinuous, dirtier, and less aesthetic.  There is plenty of fun climbing above the seventh pitch, but you have to work a little harder for it.  Besides their high quality, another nice feature of the first seven pitches is that they stay shaded into mid-afternoon, so even on a warm summer day, it was pretty comfortable.  We climbed into the sun when we pulled onto the top of the seventh pitch and it stayed with us the rest of the way.   There is a topo in the new Yosemite guidebook, which is what we used and found it to be accurate.   Approach: You can approach this climb from the bottom or from the ledge at the top of the fourth pitch.  The second option is really nice because you can leave food and water at the ledge.  The top of the fourth pitch is about 50 yards past the start of Voyager.  As of June 2016, there is a fixed line along the last section of the ledge, which is a little exposed.  There are also fixed lines going all the way down to the start of the first pitch, so you can rappel down without even having to uncoil your rope.  If those fixed lines disappear, you can rappel down with a single 70 m rope.   Pitches 1-4 (10d, 10, 10a, 10a) climb up the crack system back to the ledge.  These pitches are pretty short, so you can easily link pitches 1 and 2, as well as 3 and 4.   Pitch 5 (11a/b) is a sweet finger and hand crack, with a short section of fist or offwidth toward the top that can be laybacked.  From the bolted anchor of p5, you’ll be able to see the first bolt of p6 to your left.  Traverse over, reaching blindly for good holds that will take you up to that bolt, then onto a short layback section (10d) which turns into a perfect, cruiser hand crack that brings you to another bolted anchor.  Looking up, you’ll see the long, splitter crack of p7 (11a/b).  This is thin hands for most of the way, gradually narrowing to fingers.  As the crack starts to dissipate, some handholds will appear on the left.  You’ll follow these around the arête, at which point you may see some fixed lines off to the left.  Don’t be lured by those, they’re for another route.  Instead, follow the corner leading up and slightly to the right, and you’ll soon see another bolted anchor.  From here, you can either rap down to the ledge (a single 70 m would work), or continue upward.   Pitch 8 (5.8) follows cracks up and to the right, past a large tree and onto a large ledge.  Belay off a tree with slings and a rap ring.  The topo says p9 is 5.6, but we just unroped and scrambled up the ledge system to the base of two wide cracks.  I didn’t feel that unroping for this pitch was dangerous or exposed.  For p10, the right crack starts as hands and soon widens to a squeeze chimney (10a), which is actually pretty fun as far as squeeze chimneys go.  Follow the chimney system up to another large ledge with a big tree, then climb up another 20 feet or so to a bolted anchor.   Pitch 11 (10d) starts off with some slabby moves on polished rock, and eases up as you go past several bolts to another bolted anchor.  Pitch 12 (10a) takes you into another crack system.  My partner got off route midway up this pitch by staying in the right wide crack, which is tempting but turns out not to be a good option.  Instead, pull around to the left, into a crack that takes hand jams good gear.  There is also a bolted anchor at the top of p12.  A final short pitch up blocky and mostly easy terrain takes you to the top, where you can belay off a huge tree.   Descent: From the top of p13, you can walk off, but I don’t know how to do that or where it takes you.  What we did was rappel back down to the top of p10.  There we did a short rappel over to the right, to the top of Voyager, and rappelled down Voyager.  All of these raps can be done with a single 70 m rope.  You could also just rappel the route, but it would probably be annoying to rappel through the ledges of p8 and p9.  Also, I’m not sure all of p8-p10 are 35 meters or less.   Rack: The topo recommends nuts, a double set of cams .3” to 3” and singles 3” to 5”.  We didn’t place any nuts, and we also didn’t place the #5 c4 we brought.  The only place you might want the #5 is on the p10 squeeze chimney, but it’s not necessary.  If, like me, you really like to sew things up, an extra .75 and #1 could be handy for the long crack on p7.  Other than that, the pitches are short, so anything more than a double set of cams (and quickdraws/slings) is just extra weight.  ",,Yosemite Valley,111928132,5.11-,advanced,"Jun 29, 2016"

When you're tired of getting stressed out on those other big grade IVs, Fifi Buttress is a good place to relax and enjoy some comfortable climbing.   Linking pitches as mentioned above is easy and has the added benefit of skipping some really uncomfortable hanging belays. We linked 1+2, 3+4+5 with a 70 though 5 may be better done on it's own, 6+7, 8+9, 10, 11+12, 13. I would highly recommend linking pitch 6 with the pitch 7 splitter just after, that way you're climbing ledge to ledge and get 40ish meters of splitter. I would've placed a third .75 if I had it cause I'm a seamstress, but I didn't, so I didn't. It's that simple! Just say no to hanging belays.   It's worth climbing above pitch 7 at least once because 1) that's the route and 2) P10 is rad. Savor the chimney.   You can rap from the summit all the way down the route with a 70m rope. This involves one rap off a huge bomber slung flake at the top of P10, and most likely a rap off a tree on one of the dirtaneering pitches, otherwise follow the chains. Be very, very careful while rappelling and pulling ropes through all the dirty ledges, they are quickly eroding and there is a lot of loose rock to come down. Downclimbing pitch 9 and maybe 8 wouldn't be a bad idea to mitigate this.   Lastly, there are indeed some superfluous bolts on this route, maybe several, but nothing outrageous. Many of the bolts that are adjacent to good gear placements keep the rope away from sharp edges and the climber away from hollow features, some may not appreciate this routefinding decision being made for them but it is a sign of a lot of thought being put into the route.

Last two pitches: Stay to the right for the first half of the first of these pitches, through vegetated terrain (looks less probable and less clean than the left side, but the left side puts you into loose terrain with no reliable pro at one point looking at slopey/loose 5.8 moves and a 30' ledge fall if you blow it)   General impressions:   A really good route, with some outstanding pitches (the p1/p2 link is especially good), but a few of the belays detract from the route. Mainly the top of 2, which puts the climber directly over the belayer with a good chance of falling onto them and/or catching a foot in the belay rigging when starting the crux of p3. P5 would be much better if it were split into two with a belay at the first or second bolt, as it is the rope drag can screw you pretty bad on what is relatively hard/tenuous slab climbing.

While at the end of the pitch anchor, I was looking across the slab toward The Salathe route, and I thought it looked free climbable. I probably mentioned it to John, but we had no bolt kit to try it with.   I went back a few days later with Mike Graham, and he led the roughly 50’ traverse to the Salathe with two or three bolts, a good runout or two, and some really thin, hard slab  climbing.   We continued and found the following pitches to be straight forward and easier than the traverse.    I got the lead on Robbins’ bolt ladder pitch. I did the standard traverse left to where Royal began aid bolting up and right across the smooth slab. I easily freed past two or three bolts, and then it got blank. Rather than trying to push the line of his aid bolts, I looked around for a natural weakness, and saw a possibility out right. I was able to traverse to a good hand hold, and mantel it. This put me about 10-15’ out from the last bolt. I placed a new protection bolt, and was able to free straight up to the last bolt of Robbins’ original ladder. This free variation eliminated about 5 of his aid bolts.   As I belayed Mike from the ledge below the Half Dollar, it seemed he was taking a long time to follow the pitch. It was odd to me because the climbing wasn’t that hard and he was an ace slab climber. I couldn’t see him climbing because the whole slab changes to lower angle above the bolt ladder, and he was on the steeper part below.   When he finally appeared he was grinning ear to ear, and let out a loud “whoop!” His long hair was blowing up in the wind, the afternoon sun lighting him up on the skyline against the deep shadow of El Cap Meadow. Like a Native American warrior with a string of scalps, he victoriously held up a runner with a cluster of Royal’s bolts and hangers dangling.   “Oh shit!” I thought. We were 18 yr old punks, and Mike just chopped “The Royal” bolt ladder!   I had no idea he was doing it, and although I was shocked, I understood why he did.    This was only a couple of years after Royal climbed Harding’s Wall of the Early Morning Light, with the intention of making an ethical statement about excessive bolting on El Cap by chopping the route.    In a nutshell, if Royal thought Warren’s bolts were unnecessary,  Mike felt that we had proven Royal’s to be also unnecessary, and worthy of the same treatment!   Royal had famously claimed that his Salathe Wall route was “the greatest rock climb in the world”.  For the line, of course, but the line of Harding’s Nose Route certainly rivaled The Salathe Wall, or clearly surpassed it, by most climbers’ estimation.   The thing Royal was most proud of in that era of ethical purity was the low bolt count of, I believe, only 13 used on the First Ascent.   We eliminated about half of them that day. I never went back - I had already done the Salathe Wall, when I was 17 in 1972. I had some regrets as far as how following parties would deal with the blank slab, when the original free rating of the route was 5.9, but obviously they have worked it out somehow.   I heard Royal was a bit miffed about it, but he set the standard.  ","La Jolla, Ca",Yosemite Valley,105991737,5.11,advanced,"Nov 29, 2019"

You only do about three travers moves before doing a bump cross move with you left hand to gaina nice sloper that leads you to a pin scar and the bump to a jug, so you are still quite close to the 0.3 when the difficulties are over.

I would do this again, but would probably wear climbing shoes for it.  Done this way the 10a part of the first pitch ends up being very short and it would make sense to continue right on into the easy variation of the Boulder Problem pitch.  If doing the traditional, harder variation (11c), a belay is necessary due to the traverses.  I thought the harder variation was quite good and would whole-heartedly recommend it.     The Enduro Corner was much steeper than I expected but (the corner itself was) also much shorter than I expected.  There is a complete no-hands rest halfway up the business section which takes the Enduro out of the equation.   Next to Changing Corners, the Harding Slot was my favorite pitch on the climb.  Bring a 0.5 and #3 Camalot, and 2 each 0.75, #1, and #2 Camalots.  Nothing else (and ditch it all by the time you've entered into the slot!) or pay the price.  I dangled these pieces, along with a belay device and a locker for the anchor, from a long runner girth-hitched to a gear loop.  This worked nicely.     The harder variation on P7 felt contrived.   P10 is very scary when you're tired.  Take a long breather on the ledge before it if you have the time.   Tim DeRoehn recommended the following rack to us, which we used, and was PERFECT:   1 ea. from Black Alien to #4 C4 (#3.5 Camalot)  2 ea. from 0.5 to #3 Camalots  Single set of wires & RP's.  10 slings/draws.   This rack doesn't allow you to sew the climb up (e.g. mild back-cleaning on the Enduro Corner, some walking of gear on the upper part of Changing Corners and the following pitch), but we felt OK with it for our first time on the route, and it was nice to go fairly light.   Awesome climb!  The Rostrum is closer to the perfect climb in terms of quality, but Astroman packs in some wicked exposure (moreso than any other free climb I've done) and a lot of adventure.

In my opinion if you're not confident that you can crank a couple do-not-fall mid 5.10 moves at the end of a long day, either have your partner lead this pitch or stay away from Astroman.

Here are a few bits of information that might be useful:   - You can definitely get down from the top of the enduro corner with a single 70 meter rope. The day before we climbed the entire route we did Astroboy as a warm up. You can do a short rap from the main ledge on top of the enduro corner to hit an intermediate anchor in the 5.7 chimney. From there it is about 34 meters to the base of the corner, tie knots in the rope. So it should be possible to get down from the top of the Harding Slot with a single 70.   - Having climbed both the 5.11 boulder problem pitch and the 5.10 direct variation, I have to agree that the 5.10 makes more sense with the flow of the route. In fact you can get to the base of the enduro corner in one pitch - it is possible to link the 5.7, 5.10a and the final direct 5.10 to the base of the corner in 70 meters, just watch the rope drag and consider having the second simul-climb a bit. This could be good beta to get past a slower party starting out. All this said, I think everyone should give the 5.11c variation a try, it is good fun!   - Climb the Harding Slot with the left side in. We went into the slot having heard right side in was the way to go, now we know on good authority that we did it the wrong way! To get into the slot, climb the easy staircase crack, do the strenuous layback section (not as bad as it looks) to a good resting stance, make sure you've got a .75 and #1 Camalot left on your rack. Commit to tight hand jamming and just go for it. Eventually you will get to two little ""jugs"" in the jam crack. Get the top one with your left hand and then open up your body and commit to the left side in chimney. Don't overthink it, just go for it! And the fall is really, really clean.   - For rack, we had: handful of offset and regular nuts, single set TCUs, double run of BD cams .3 to #3, extra .75 and #1, single #4 Camalot. We were happy with that rack.   - The enduro corner begins to go into the shade around 11:30am or so when we were there (early June). We topped out in the dark but agreed that climbing in the shade was the way to go. We watched the moon rise over Half Dome as we got fired up to send the scary last pitch by headlamp.

P1: 5.7 scramble  Don't place any gear on this pitch at all if you want to link through p2 up to the base of the Boulder Problem in one pitch, which would be the better than pitching it out. I placed two pieces on p1 and found there to be too much rope drag when reaching the 10a lieback section on p2 to comfortably link the pitches. As of 4/16, p1 was mostly dry with a wet section toward the end, but that section has good jugs.   P2: 10a lieback  The 10a lieback is short and a lot of fun. If wanting to do the Boulder Problem for p3 rather than the straight up 5.10 face climbing variation, make sure the p2 leader continues left, past the 2 bolt anchor at the base of the 10a bypass variation, to the start of the boulder problem. Otherwise you will lose time having to move the belay over 15 feet or so. The belay at the bottom of the boulder problem takes BD 0.75 in a downward, horizontal crack at your feet. As a result, the belayer will be on the slab below this.   P3: 11c Boulder Problem or 10a direct bypass face climbing variation  The lower section is currently protected by a bomber lost arrow piton (I hung and fell on it). Stand up high on the small block at the base to reach and clip it. I had DMM Peenuts and had no success in getting them to stick in lower part of the seam. A purple Metolius cam (size 0) fits nicely higher up the seam. The Boulder Problem felt about V5 for me and is a block separated from the main wall by a very thin, right leaning crack/seam. You use the pin scars and wider sections of the seam as crimps. Look for small crystals for the feet both right and left of the seam. Toward the top, get your left hand as high as possible in order to reach/span up to the next good hold with the right hand. It's not over after the top of the boulder; a short 5.10 traverse on edges awaits to gain the crack out right. Be sure to place gear (yellow C3 or 0.3 BD) at the top of the boulder to protect the traverse and the follower.   P4: Enduro Corner  This is a quite appropriately named pitch. There aren't any stopper moves, they just stack up over time. Being able to utilize the right face with the feet seems like a key to efficiency. The reason is that the right face is less than vertical while the left face overhangs, leaning to the right. As a result, when you jam straight in to the crack (which goes into the left face), you're climbing an overhanging crack, while if you lieback or use the right face for the right foot, you're climbing a less than vertical crack. Body english on your left side helps. The long section of off-finger width is brutal; just hang in there. A thumb-bridge or ringlock can work for the left hand through that section. Then the crack thins a bit more for some sustained liebacking.    P5: Easy 5.8 hands to 5.9 hands in short overhang. #3 protects bottom of overhang and #2 protects the top. Beware the loose flakes below the short overhang. Cool, comfortable stance at the top of this pitch.    Pro (only specific to first 5 pitches):   We took the recommended Supertopo rack, doubles from purple Metolius 0/BD C3 00 to BD # 3, 1 extra each of 0.5, 0.75, 1 & 2 BD to make triples of those sizes, 1 # 4 BD, DMM aluminum offset nuts, DMM Peenuts, # 1, 2, & 3 BD stoppers (smallest ones), and 7 alpine draws. Single 70m rope.   No BD #4 cam was needed for the first 5 pitches. Only a single BD #3 was used. Triples of BD 0.75 and #1 and were helpful for the Enduro Corner; triples of BD 0.5 and 2 were not needed. Only a single purple Metolius 0 was used. The gray Metolius 00 was not used but may be useful for the Boulder Problem. I think we used only 2 draws on any of the first 5 pitches. You could probably forego bringing any nuts banking on the piton being there to protect the Boulder Problem; micronuts would be needed to protect the lower part of it otherwise.   Getting Down:   Only a single 70m rope was needed for rappelling from the top of p5. From the top of p5, rap to the intermediate/lower anchor near the Enduro Corner's chimney section. From there, rap to the base of the Enduro corner with a small swing left to gain the anchor. From the bottom of the Enduro corner rap to the bottom of p2 near the large pine tree. From there rap to the ground.   We planned to also climb p6 but couldn't tell if it was possible to rap from the top of p6 with a single 70m rope. Looking at it from the top of p5, there appeared to be a single bolt at the halfway point (as indicated in the Supertopo) and no ring.

Linking the 100' approach pitch with the 10a fingers is a pretty rough warmup with the rope weight and I wouldn't do it again.   It's possible to haul your extra gear/helmets/etc on the Harding Slot with a single rope by making your partner untie and using that end as a tag line.   There is still a loose death block below the Changing Corners mantle on the ledge off to the right.   A fixed #4 on the penultimate pitch makes bringing only 1 #4 extra reasonable.  ,"San Mateo, CA",Yosemite Valley,105845493,5.11c,advanced,"Jun 20, 2022"

Big cams can be used on this pitch but not crucial.   P2 - Take doubles of #3. A #4 can also be used here but you can get by without it in case you opt to leave the big cams on the ledge above p3 for later pickup.   P3 - the only pitch I thought it would be nice to have triples of hand sizes cams 2's & 3's but you can bump them along to save weight. Big cams can be used on this pitch if you brought them along.   P4 - The purple C3 was only used at the start of p4 before reaching the finger crack and it's probably fine to go without it. No big cams #4 or #5 needed. Extend pieces before and after traverse.   P5 - Can use a green or red C3 right off the belay (however the red was very tight, shifted, and we almost lost it.) Two fixed pins in chimney off belay protect the opening moves. I placed triples of 0.5 on p5 since we had an extra along in case we would try the Alien Roof, but 2 will suffice.   P6 - Single 4 & 5 are adequate. The OW size is such that you can bump the 5 the entire way and can leave the 4 behind you as pro (deeper in the crack) anywhere it fits, and there are plenty of options deep in the crack along the way. Take a single set of cams in addition to the #4 and #5 and all the runners. Bring doubles of 0.3; a 0.3 protects the first crux move over the bulge/narrower section (my left knee did not fit here) where you can no longer stem against the right wall. Left side in seems like the way to go after the first crux bulge which you can use face holds to pull past. If you place your only red C3 right off the belay, you may want to back clean it to use it up higher to protect around the OW; there are lots of options for small gear on the lower section of the OW. This is the pitch that requires the most runners. There is a fixed pin about 10 feet above and right of the belay with a long runner on it to protect the traverse. There is a bolt left of the wide crack, which does a good job of keeping the rope out of your way if you clip it short.   P7 - Can use a #4 (or #5 even) to protect the brief wide section before underclinging the giant block.   P8 - A 0.5 or 0.75 in a horizontal shelf left of the entry of the wide crack can protect the entry moves into it. A #4 also works to protect the entry moves and you can bump it up afterward. No need to backclean your big cams. You can leave them in the crack by placing a 0.4 Camalot sized cam in a horizontal crack on the left wall at the very top of the pitch after the climbing is essentially over. This will keep the rope running straight down the pitch, preventing it from pulling your cams into the deep crack. Also, there is a spot to place a small cam (purple C3 to about 0.3 C4 works) inverted about 3/4 of the way up the pitch behind a small edge out right that also keeps the rope from dragging your big cams into the crack (good to put a runner on it).

I’ve climbed this route 1 3/8 times now, and on both times I’ve experienced parties cutting in line and causing delays.    First time, it was a “climbing ranger” who was kind enough to pull her rope aside after she got through the crux and let us pass through.  I recall being frustrated at having to wait for an extended period of time, but at least this party was somewhat considerate and let us pass.    Yesterday was a different story.  2 parties decided to cut in by the time we reached the top of pitch 3.  First party, I was able to see hang all over pitch 5.  Also, they were carrying huge packs, for essentially a 5 pitch route, I’m sure that was fun on the upper pitches.  Second party to cut in, proceeded to hang all over pitch 4, while we sat and waited on the ledge for 45 minutes.  Maybe warming up on the Crux pitch of the Rostrum wasn’t the best introduction to Yosemite guys.  Long story short, we bailed.   Moral of the story is, if you’re going to elect to cut in on the Rostrum, I think you should at least be dialed in on the route, and not add to the cluster that occurs on this super classic route.  You fully cost my partner the experience of on-sighting this route.  Also, fwiw, I fully let the second parties second climber know my feelings regarding their actions, I’m posting this in hopes that future parties will be more considerate of others.

Laybacks, splitter fingers, steep hands, OW, a chimney, and cruiser hand cracks from tight #1s to big #3s in corners of opposite orientations.  Every pitch is an absolute blast!  If you regularly climb in the Creek, the pitch four fingers crux will be the easiest stretch of rock on the route for you.     A tagline and small haulbag were a great asset on this route.  You can leave your big cams in there for the majority of the route (though there are places to dump the #5 early on p1-p3) and let everyone climb unencumbered.  The only time we encountered issues with hauling was on the last pitch, but this could be avoided by hauling from directly above the p7 belay instead of where you finish the route yourself (we went right).     If you opt to traverse right for the final pitch, consider bringing your big cams all the way to the summit with you as well as extending your anchor.  I saw a #5 that tumbled down the crack (bring your fishing rod, booty hunters) and wondered how it got there.  My question was answered when my own wide piece got pushed around by the rope and nearly suffered the same fate.     The first rappel into the route is no longer on a tree, but instead from two bolts at eye-level.  If you have a 60m rope, do a short rappel to start with (giving you 4 raps total).  I thought there were only three rappels, so I rappelled to my knots and stopped just close enough to clip the anchor but too far away to easily transition off the rope.    I stopped earlier on p1 than listed on the Sloan topo and described here.  It felt like a better stance and provided more protection when getting into the 11a thin finger crack on p2.  I back-cleaned the first few pieces I placed in the finger crack to better protect my follower and ease on the rope drag.

Crux is thin face climbing to the right of bolts. Second half of pitch is protected primarily by fixed pins and a very old bolt.  P2: a good bolt protects the initial moves into a thin arching crack with some fixed gear. The crack ends as you move on to tricky face moves that felt like solid 5.10. A bit runout here.  P3: Fun 5.10a corner to cruiser 5.8 corner.  P4: This pitch is short and basically moves the belay up and left to facilitate   access to the next pitch. Look for old slings to mark the belay.  P5: Great exposed 5.10a move to juggy 5.8 crack. Ends at a comfy ledge.  Crack selection is not an issue here; that is more of an issue higher up.  P6: The crux. Slippery, steep and exposed. With a few fixed pieces and a bunch of small cams and wires this protects well. Link this pitch with the next pitch in the Reid guide. 70 meter rope mandatory.  P7: This pitch, at 5.11c, is rated the same as the previous pitch but felt much easier. Short and powerful, punch through to good jams on overhanging rock. Mantle on to a ledge with five old bolts as an anchor.  P8: Wild traverse right on good holds with somewhat sporadic pro. Be sure to protect your follower on the downclimbing section. Bring the bigger cams on this pitch. We used both a #4 friend as well as a #4 camalot.  P9: The routefinding crux for us. Traverse on thin 5.10 face right. Pass an off-route crack, go further right to a 5.8 crack that passes through a 5.10a roof. When in doubt on the traverse go further right than you would think.  P10: 5.10b moves to start lead to a super fun crack/face jug haul.  P11: Hyper-exposed 5.7 angling traverse on a huge block leads to an inobvious 5.8 crux. Fairly short pitch. Belay low enough to start the next pitch on a featured face traverse.  P12: Traverse easily (5.6) to a fist crack. Up this thuggishly utilizing face holds to a very large ledge.  P13: Clean hand to finger crack (5.10d) leads to a thin (5.10c) face traverse protected by a funky, but seemingly solid, pin. Continue up the corner all the way to Thanksgiving ledge. This is a linked pitch. Be sure to use long slings down low or ropedrag can be a real problem. 70 meter rope is mandatory to link.  P14 and beyond: Move belay to the far left end of the ledge. Climb up a 5.6 corner. The pitches above get progressively easier until you are fourth classing it to the top.

Ray Jardine has long been credited with the first ascent. According to a Climbing magazine article, he worked on the route with hangs, making several hangdog ascents. Then, he redpointed the route, thus making the first ascent & first free ascent. Traditionally yo-yoing was considered the valid style of attempting hard free climbs. If you fell you lowered off to the start of the pitch. Then re-climbed the route, leaving the rope in place, thus top roping back to the high point. A successful yo-yo ascent, like a redpoint ascent, meant climbing from the ground (or belay stance) to the top of the lead without weighting the rope. Difference is with redpointing you don't leave the rope in place. You pull the rope down thus re leading the climb..    To respond to Jon Roderick's comment: yo-yoing is not aid, hangdogging is aid. Jardine employed the tactic of hangdogging, but finally sent climbs redpoint. My understanding is that Jardine considered the redpoint ascent to be leading the climb without weighting the rope & placing all the pro on the free ascent.   He was controversial in the 1970s for employing euro-style tactics. He was often slandered in California. So I have regard the first ascent info on the post as slander or misinformation .

After a few hundred yards or so you should be able to see the maintenance yards or stables below you. You will also see below you a rockfall/wash or drainage. Do not go directly down the drainage. Continue following the trail a bit further, it will gradually start to descend and then doubles back toward the drainage.

One wrong step on the loose, slippery dirt of the trail could easily send one fatally sliding right over the cliff in several places. I'd recommend using a different descent option or roping up.

Getting to the lower falls pools:   From the top of pitch 3, you have the option of either topping out or keeping a keen eye out for the horizontal climber's trail that runs across the ascent (it's easy to miss if you're focused on climbing).   -Topping out involves 250-300' of dirty choss scrambling upwards and is not very fun. Once you reach the top, hug the slab and go right down an obvious gully. At the bottom of this gully it turns into a downwards gully that goes to the cliff. Follow this down till you see the obvious climber's trail to the right, and take that trail.   -If you were looking out for the climber's trail on the way up the choss, you should've spotted it in less than 100' of scrambling up. This is the same trail taken in the first option - if you are facing upwards, take this trail left towards the falls. It is pretty obvious the whole way, although there's a couple offshoot trails that dead end pretty quickly. Once you see the pools below, just walk down and slightly right across the slab, then sharp left near the bottom for an easy boulder downclimb. Time to enjoy cool, refreshing water and amazing views!   Once you've enjoyed the falls to your hearts content, there are a few descent options:  -If you brought two 70m ropes, you can rappel down the falls from the station near the waterfall itself.   -If you brought one 70m rope, you can walk back to the route itself, downclimb a bit and rappel from trees either down the way you came up, or sharp right over the cliff into the gully (this sharp right is from the top of pitch 3). There are some hidden-ish rappel rings in the gully as well. While this can be done with one 70m rope, we hit the ends of our rope twice and had to use some smaller trees as intermediate rappel stations, so I don't necessarily recommend this option.   -Walk off by taking the climber's trail in the other direction. I did not take this option, so can't give very detailed instructions, but I was told it is past the gully I described in the beginning. You should be able to see a talus field as well as the stables if you go this way. This is the ""sketchy"" descent described in the comments multiple times.

The crux of this climb for me was route finding.    I screwed up on the first pitch. I read go left at the flake and I took it too literally and went left up a ledge/crack to a large tree... not the large tree I was looking for. The top of the first pitch is on the top right of the crack/gully. Extra pitch off route aside, the rest of the climb was fun.    I also had to pause at the top of the second pitch--looking up there are two cracks that look climbable: go up the right one until you reach an obvious and very exposed right traverse on a ledge. We set up a belay on gear in a small crack on the traverse ledge. There was a fixed nut there which I was glad to see. The crack takes some nuts and tiny cams.   The third pitch goes up a corner on the right of the ledge with a tree sticking out. From the top of that corner, there are a bunch of slabs with some cracks. It looks like there are several ways you can go here. I went up a weird slab with a small crack. Eventually you reach a flat-ish area with a bunch of hilly slabs. I probably should've set up a another belay on a tree here, but I went further up a bunch of runout slabs with a ton of rope drag.  I nearly ran out of rope on a 70m rope when I finally set up a belay on a ledge with a manzanita about 15 feet below the trail. In hindsight I definitely wouldve should've set up an intermediate pitch.    We couldn't see the trail even from 15 feet below it, so I scrambed up a very short final pitch to the obvious trail.    The descent was terrifying. The trail going left toward what I think is supposed to be pools or the falls was wet and exposed; I took one look, said no thanks, and started heading right. The trail was relatively easy to follow, but often leaves you wondering if you missed some easier turnoff somewhere. We had no other beta than to keep going right, so that's what we did. The trail is narrow, loose, and terribly exposed. In hindsight I should have stayed roped up for a lot of it. There are a bunch of sections on narrow dirt paths where a small slip means instant death. I was seriously terrified and starting to ponder what my mother would think if I slipped and died. Eventually we reached a series of wet slabs and ledges, which again caused some pause. I went down to the bottom and saw a narrow exposed path, which I cautiously proceeded while my partner waited on the top ledge. This is where I spotted the trail and a large boulder-filled gully.   After a long and nervous hour or so wondering if we were going the right way, we finally realized the worst was over. From there the trail got a lot more slippery, but was not exposed, so a fall would only mean some scrapes. We came down the far side of a large very cool gully filled with giant granite boulders. This was definitely the most relieved I've ever been to set foot on a trail and see tourists walking around.    Definitely going to look for repel options next time.

For p1 after about 50-60 vertical feet, I belayed at the wrong tree on a ledge (first tree on the right), then we scrambled up 15 more feet to the 2nd tree on the right to start p2, right before the narrow slot in the gully.  P2 had ""obvious cracks"" on the right that were only about 8' tall, leading to a ledge and unprotectable easy scramble to another ledge. This is where we didn't know where to go, but we finally decided it was on-route. On the 2nd ledge there was a flake to the left (looked like 5.7/5.8 layback or hand jams?), two protectable cracks in the middle (that started about 8' off the ledge), and a boulder move to a ledge and a tree on the right. We took the easiest way up, the boulder move on the right.  From there, p3 offered 3 ways up: some broken cracks to the left near the gully, the big crack/dihedral in the middle above another small tree, and some easy face moves with small cracks to the right. 2 of us went up the crack/dihedral (BD Camalot #2 and #3, maybe also a #1?) and the 3rd went up the face to the right.  After that was the traverse to the right (can place a cam in middle of traverse to protect follower) to the tree then up a hand crack. Above that I placed a BD gree 0.75 then had a choice of a hand crack to the left or a fist crack to the right, leading up to a small tree where I ran out of rope (60m) and belayed. The party ahead of us had a 70m rope so continued 30' higher to belay from a small manzanita.    from the small manzanita, can scramble up to the trail (some 5.1 to 5.3 slab moves) or belay someone up as a 4th pitch, but there's not much protection for a rope until you reach more big bushes right below the trail--can belay someone up from there if they are not comfortable soloing it.  At the top, there are two trails going left to the pools; the lower is a little sketchy but the upper is chill. Do not try to enter the pools when the waterfall is flowing!     Walk-off trail to the right was tedious but not dangerous--if you choose the right path (tend left/uphill whenever possible), it only runs right next to the cliff edge about 3 times but there is a rock shelf that could be wet with flowing water early in the season. Descending the rock gully is slow and annoying but not dangerous if it's dry and you take your time. When you get to the first gully, cross it then the path immediately descends along the far side (left if you're facing downhill) then turns into the gully with some switchbacks into the trees.  Enter the trees and descend for a bit along the edge of the gully, then descent the open part of the talus-filled gully to the nice paved path that runs behind the stables.

In retrospect, I should have gone straight up passed the shady belay up the slab to a nice wall with a horizontal crack for the belay. From there we unroped and walked up to the right to the climber trail for the descent.    The descent is fine, and the trail itself is well worn and hardpacked.

Of note, I did the first rappel with a 100m, and the  rope just barley made it to the second rap station. There is an intermediate set of bolts that look pretty shoddy, but you could try them lol (I wouldnt)    That quasi-2nd rappel station currently sits where the waterfall widens out, so expect to occasionally get showered on especially when the wind picks up- and be assured, even though its summer the water is brisk.   For the 2nd pitch of the rappel, I hung right, and be careful because there is big swing potential and its easy to slip. There is a piton and another quasi intermediate rap station on this pitch with slings in them that you can clip when you pass to keep from swinging all the way left into the waterfall.  The intermediate rap station sits on a mildly left sloping ledge, so if you do swing you should be able to work your way back right where you'll then be mostly lined up with the intermediate rap station. So, if you clip the aforementioned piton sling and rap station the swing potential should be mitigated after that point.    Another thing of note, the 2nd rappel was done with a full 60m and a tag line, with just a few meters to spare. So while the 100m was sufficient for the first rap, it might not be enough for the 2nd rappel.    Finally, there's enough water at the bottom that you will get submerged. Maybe not completely, but unless you're freakishly tall then expect to get torso deep in water at minimum. Be prepared to swim immediately right if you're facing the wall or straight left if you're facing away from the wall into the narrowing corridor rather than towards the pool that opens up to the other side   This rappel IS really cool but wanted to let anyone considering it to be prepared for wet conditions. I did it once at night and a couple times during the day; when its sunny, I think its quite enjoyable but if its cloudy or windy it's going to be a cold time. Best to be prepared accordingly in rain gear and such   I'm sure when water flow is lower it can be a lot more enjoyable. It was still fun but conditions, IMO, at the moment are not ideal.    So, tl;dr. Expect to get wet, expect to swim rn, you'll need two lines 60m or a tag line.   Oh, also, since the ropes are wet they're proper hard to pull. Make sure your ducks are in a row in terms of set up and direction of pull. Also needed a few people to pull it anyway, so keep your party on hand not just one person to help pull the ropes.

The top of our second pitch easily reached the double bolt rap anchors.

It's really easy climbing following a wide horizontal crack hand over hand, but a follower fall would result in a pretty nasty swing into the corner.  - I thought the moves under/exiting the roof were the clear crux, and maybe hard for 5.6? I think I would have been pretty nervous if I was a 5.8 or below leader  - I didn't think the route was that dirty, some loose dirt on a few holds at the top was all. I've climbed wayyy dirtier (but still highly rated) routes in the valley.   - I looked all over and didn't find a bolted anchor at the top as indicated in the Sloan topo. Or even evidence of a chopped anchor (???). I slung the tree with a bight of my rope and extended myself and the belay back to the edge so I could see my follower.

The route is straightforward, scenic but not too exposed, and takes good gear.    The above beta is all accurate. First 15-20 feet are the hardest, and slowly eases off over the course of the climb. I was intimidated by some of the descriptions of Pitch 3 but it was actually probably the most mellow, comfortable climbing of the entire route - great feet the whole way up. Additionally, I agree with the above comment that distances seem overestimated. I did not measure myself but I don't think the actual climbing (as opposed to walking) part of P3 is any longer than 35'.    Traffic and wind noise from the road nearby can make hearing your partner a little difficult. When I walked from the P2 belay up to the begin of the actual 5th class part of P3, I built an anchor there and had my partner come up and belay me from that spot. It allowed better communication and also reduced sideways rope pull if I were to fall. Quite honestly you could probably belay from that spot even without an anchor as the ledge is still quite large. There are thick manzanita bushes, boulders, and of course the crack itself which all support good anchoring if necessary.   There is some webbing with a rap ring off to the right of the top of P3. We walked off WEST. Was relatively easy to find the climber's trail. Go back and slightly left from the top of P3 and you can't miss it.

What an amazing day.  A trip report:   - We left our car at the Glacier Apron lot at 7:45 and hiked directly from there.  The SuperTopo suggests taking the bus to the Happy Isles, but saving the .5 miles hiking didn't seem worth that effort.   - In addition to the light rack recommended above, we brought a sandwich and two energy bars each, plus 2.5 liters of water per person on a moderate/warm April day.  In retrospect, the food was more-or-less sufficient but the water was lean.  You may want to bring purification tablets so you can use the stream/snowmelt (if available) for water refill sources as opposed to lugging more water weight.   - Although the SuperTopo approach beta suggested taking the:  Muir Trail > Mist Trail > Muir Trail  we accidentally missed the Mist Trail turn-off and wound up hiking to Clark Point before heading a bit back down across the valley.  In retrospect, this didn't add much time and allowed us to avoid the oft-slippery Mist Trail portion as we stayed on well-groomed dry switchbacks all the way to Clark Point.  Not a bad alternative.   - After getting to the shoulder of Liberty Cap, the beta is to basically hug that rock as you head left, keeping tabs on a faint trail.  Soon you'll reach the gap between Liberty and Half Dome, where you'll turn right to traverse the gap before the terrain will turn more flat (a small stream will be on your left).  The trail then becomes fainter again, and the terrain more wooded.  At this point, we crossed the stream at an arbitrary point and found the start of the extensive cairns leading to the base.   - The toughest part of the approach felt like the last bit of hiking straight up steep, loose faint switchbacks in the heat of the morning, then traversing the Half Dome base to the route start.  Take your time in this section so you're not too burned out for the route itself.   - It took us a while to ID the route start from the SuperTopo because the cairns actually pass the Snake Dike route and go a little further to the base of a different route (I believe this is the ""SW Face"" route).  The key to finding Snake Dike is IDing the ""three trees"" in the topo that bracket the route from below.   - Lead this route only if you feel super-solid leading 5.8.  I think if you lead at a lower level, the extensive run-outs might feel pretty scary (though the climbing itself is very solid, especially after P2).   - Once on top of Half Dome, don't miss the epic photos from the top.  Recommendation is to (carefully) position one photographer on the ""diving board"" and the other(s) across the top for great views!   - I highly recommend prusiking into the Half Dome cables on the descent, especially if the cables are down.  That bit is pretty steep and you'll likely be pretty tired by that point, so better safe than sorry.   - We went for the one-day approach and although it was an exhausting day (took us 11 hours, 55 minutes car-to-car with minimal rests), I think this is the best way to do it as long as it's not too hot out.  We did see a couple parties during our decent hiking up to camp out at the base and do it in two days, but the prospect of carrying camping gear and more food/water up and down that approach did not sound fun.   If you have any other questions about the route, it'll be fresh in my mind for a while, so feel free to email!  ","Salt Lake City, UT",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Apr 28, 2013"

This is the way to do it!  We had the summit to ourselves and only one other party. Very surreal at sunset.    Anyway, before we went for it, I asked around Yosemite (mountain shop and ranger station) and very quickly shopped the internet about the beta when the cables were down, and pretty much got nothing solid.  In my mind for some reason, I was envisioning the cables being just one long continuous cable system, anchored only at the bottom and the top.  In hindsight, this is quite a retarded assumption.   Obviously one long continuous cable is not the case.  There are giant intermediate eye bolts every so often, with smaller cables connecting these points to the main cable, as well as a few junctions of separate cables.  Despite these facts, when I was asking how to descend these safely at the mountain shop and got, ""uh, I mean people definitely do it..."" and not much of any other relevant info, to which I probed, ""...so do people just use a Prusik?""  To which he said, ""...ya.""  The ranger station was less help, providing the same, ""people do it..."" along with a disclaimer that the parks service didn't recommend it.   I was taking my girlfriend up this route, and the cables, with the knowledge they would be down, scared the shit out of her. My only option was to find the absolute safest way down these things, or I would not be sending.  I thought Prusik was my answer...   When we arrived at the cables, due to the dome shape, I could only see about 30 feet of cable.  So we set up Prusik's along with a PAS locked onto the cable, for some redundancy.  We began the descent and quickly ran into a cable support described above, so we were forced to untie the prusik and retie it on the other side of the support.  Then 20 feet later it happened again. And again.... I could see this was becoming a continuous theme, and finally decided this prusik system would literally take hours and could not continue.   The giant eye-bolts were pretty frequent, and provided a perfect rap anchor.  We had a single 60m, and only in one spot was it not long enough to rap to the next eye-bolt, to which we then employed the prusik system I originally devised and slid down to the next eye-bolt and continued our rap.  If you had double ropes, you could very easily make it in 3-4 raps, with no prusik shenanigans.   So, these are the scenarios I can see in order from quickest to slowest (and sketchiest to safest) for descending the cables when they are down for the season:   Just go hand over hand on the cables, solo, no pro. A guy in another party did this in front of us and descended them in ~5 minutes. X rated.Go hand over hand on the cables, but clipped into the cable Via Ferrata style. R rated.  If I did this again, (not with my girlfriend or other equally weary 2nd), this would absolutely be the way to go. You could still take a nasty R rated fall, but being clipped into the cables, you would be stopped at the next junction. Descending in this way would almost be as fast as doing it solo.  Via Ferrata would ensure you would always remain clipped in while changing over at cable junctions/supports.  The cables route is very slick from the 1 million+ ascents of tourists, so as mentioned above, better to walk on the outside of whichever cable you choose to clip into.Rappel the cables. G Rated.  As mentioned above, there are giant eye-bolt supports all over this thing, which makes rappelling a very doable scenario, even with a single rope.  Double ropes would make quick work of it, and with a single rope there is one section (unfortunately the steepest part) where your rope doesn't get you to the next eye-bolt.  Be sure you've tied knots at the end of your rope, and when you reach this point, Prusik into the cable, preferably backing it up with some form of PAS (personal anchor system).  Hand-over-hand down the cable until you get to the next eye-bolt, then pull your rope and continue the series of raps.  This took us awhile, as rapping does, but it was an absolutely solid way to descend these with very little sketchiness.  For anyone taking someone up Snake Dike that is not willing to risk any form of fall, this is the way to go.   Hope this helps a few people out.

If you bring a filter, water's available about halfway up at Little Yosemite.  If not, there's fresh water at Vernal Falls footbridge, a little less than a mile into the hike.  You'd definitely want to top off there.  - On pitch 1, there's a 5.9 undercling immediately below the roof (see the many YouTube videos), or an easier 5.7 traverse 10-15 feet below.  If you look on the videos, you'll see a clear border of different colored rock - the lower part has much better grip.  - As for the cables, do remember to bring grippy gloves, and my two cents is that it's easiest to climb down backwards.  In addition to letting you grip with the balls of your feet rather than heels, and allowing your arms to stay locked, you get a clear view of the person above you.  Based on my one experience, perhaps the greatest danger on the entire route is one of the overly-tired hikers plowing into you from above - you'd at least see them climbing backwards.  - For what it's worth, we felt the hike to the base, after leaving the main trail, was one of the nicest in all Yosemite.

On Crowds:  Even early in the season (and early in the morning), there was a party of three at the base in front of us, and a party not far behind. Luckily, the party of three let us go ahead; by the time we lost sight of them (on the 6th pitch) they were still at the third. An efficient and confident party could easily summit in two hours, but in my opinion, climbers should plan for 4 hours on route.   On Gear:  Our light rack proved perfect. It was nice and light for the long approach, yet I was able to comfortably protect the friction traverse on the first pitch as well as build decent anchors on the 7th and 8th.   On Descending:  The cables were still down for the season, but the descent was pretty painless. We wore gloves and tied prussiks around the cables to descend. We had to re-tie the prussiks multiple times to get around points where the cables were fixed (and to avoid ascending hikers), but still managed to get down the cables in roughly 15 minutes.   On the Experience:  In all, this climb was fantastic and well worth the grueling approach. It would not be a wise choice for a 5.7 climber, but 5.8  climbers will likely enjoy it, and more experienced climbers should not discount it.

You will want to go as light as you can on the route, but when you are coming down, you'll want water and there won't be any for about 8 miles.  Solution: bring a light weight water pump and pump at the river about 1/2 down the descent.       Approach:  Maybe the crux of the climb.  Get to Happy Isles.  We had to park in Half Dome Village Parking lot (formerly known as Curry Village).  Get on the John Muir trail and hike up forever.  You'll pass two waterfalls (Nevada and Vernal, but maybe not in that order).  This part of the trail is very steep.     Once you get past the second waterfall, the trail will level out.  Liberty Cap will be on your left.  Apparently there is an approach that goes towards Liberty Cap, but we didn't take it.  Keep hiking until Liberty Cap tapers off. There will be a climbers trail on your left, and it's not terribly hard to miss.    GPS coordinates for the climbers trail: N 37.73160, W 119.52110.     Follow the climbers trail for a long while.  You'll pass Lost Lake on your right.  Eventually the trail will lead you into a shrubby talus scramble.  We followed cairns all the way to the base of the route.  It tends leftward and is pretty long.  Here are GPS coordinates for the start of the climb: N 37.73980, W 119.54020.    The Climb:   There's plenty of beta on this already, so I'll just say this: the climbing was less secure and much more scary than I expected.  Though it's easy, portions of the Dike are somewhat slippery, and there aren't really any good, solid holds until the very end.    There was one section of the climb where I ran my 70 M rope all the way out and only clipped two pieces, so I'm going to give this an X.   Also, on P3, if you fall on the 5.7 friction traverse before getting to the bolt, you will totally land on your belayer.  Follow the 1000 ft or so of calf burning 3rd class to the summit.  This is probably the crux of the climb and we had to rest maybe 4-8 times while doing it.     The Descent:   Take the Half Dome cables down.  We followed the advice of others and just clipped our PAS into the cables and walked around the outside, cutting the huge lines and traffic jam.  This upset some people in line and was very scary for my partner, but I would do it again in a heart beat.    Follow the trail back down to wherever you parked your car.  Use the water pump at the river along the way or this hike is going to suck.  This is why some people call the route Snake Hike.  It's not because the climbing is easy, it's because you hike about 18 mi in a day.    ","Salt Lake City, UT",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Sep 14, 2016"

I'd been climbing for less than a year and had lead maybe 10 pitches of trad before this, but all similar rock (Lovers leap, Tahquitz, etc) and all multi-pitch, we both had a fair bit of experience with belay transitions etc.   P1 we put a cam in at the roof on the right side, downclimbed to the non-polished rock then traversed over. My partner got a micro-cam in on the upward crack but it popped out, then got another good piece in higher up and then proceeded to the bolted anchors. The cam popping out was actually helpful for me seconding, since I didn't have a pendulum potential once I got the roof piece out.   For my lead I started the traverse left towards the dike too early and didn't go high enough. By the time I saw the traverse bolt, I was way below it, so I just kept traversing until I got onto the dike. Really scary given that if I blew it, I would have fallen straight onto my belayer and then pendulumed. Once onto the dike it was a lot easier, but I ended up being so in the zone that I missed the anchors on the left and going all the way to the single bolt and then finishing at the anchors on the right, barely having enough rope with a 70M. That was a lot better for my second, though.    Above P3 it was easy. As the person above said, the dike holds are generally not very positive, but I found it not scary at all if you go one move at a time and make sure your feet are good. Definitely recommend a 70M and linking pitches, just make sure to use the topo and do the math.    On the hike, we started at 4AM from Happy Isles and were at the base of the route at 7:15, first on the route. We reached the summit at 11 and were back down in the valley by 3.

I was in the Marine Corps infantry for 8 years, so I truly mean that--the hike is relentless. Me and my partner are also fairly conservative when it comes to gear, so we brought doubles for the route but this truly can be done with a good attitude, 2 quick draws, 4 slings, and singles from .2 - 1. Just take what you need. Once you step off from the trailhead, follow the Mist Trail all the way until you reach the wooden bridge just after Vernal Falls. We brought a water filter and filtered 6 liters of water each just upstream from the bridge prior to going any further because were unsure about any other water sources up ahead and we still had a ways to go in 90+ degree heat. However, there was a small stream another 30 minutes up. After crossing the bridge, follow the hiker's trail up until you can literally touch Liberty Cap. At this point, the hiker's trail veers right and a climber's trail veers left--this is your left turn. Follow this trail, skirting the side of Liberty Cap and social trails until it takes you up between Mt. Broderick and Liberty Cap. At this point the trail becomes a little lost with brush and talus, so you just have to pick the best route through. Once you get past the two formations, you should see Half Dome to your left at which point you should start heading up until you see an open meadow. This meadow is Lost Lake and several cairns can be seen to your immediate left. At this point there is no obvious trailhead and you may be lulled into going right. Instead, go left skirting the left side of the open meadow and a well-traveled trail will present itself. If you find yourself bush wacking at any point from here on out you are off track. Follow the climbers trail up until you reach another junction with two cairns marking trails going both left and right, either way takes you up but right is more direct. The next junction you arrive to is where these two trails meet. So, if you opted to go right, do not go left at the second junction as this will just take you back down hill. Go up and right up what appears to be a scary slab. Once you take this trail, the cairns mark the way through the slabs avoiding any scary committing moves. Everything felt pretty solid and at no point did I feel like I was doing any actual climbing.   The climb -- Apparently, there is an alternate start to this route however my partner opted for the regular start and ended up climbing into the undercling to place protection. From there he traversed hard left, staying true to the undercling which afforded him adequate protection but felt a bit harder than 5.7. As someone who hates slab, I can honestly say that everything else after this pitch felt really easy in comparison and was waiting for several more ""5.7 cruxes"" that just never came. Once you get past pitch 1 everything is cruiser and just a mental game of staying calm high above your protection. At the top of pitch 2, you will see a right leaning dike with a bolt 15 ft up--this is a 10a route. Pitch 3 goes left here! From here, just follow the route beta and you should be just fine.   The descent -- Head down the cables and follow the Half-Dome hiker's trail back towards Liberty Cap for 8 knee-pounding miles.

The runouts were noticeable but it's easy so you're climbing fast enough that it doesn't feel as far between the bolts as it is.   The friction traverse on the third pitch was super easy, you could basically walk over. Someone even left paracord between the bolts which made it even easier.   There's one odd bolt on pitch six (the only one I found) towards the end, right before the steep part. Climbing this again, I would just skip it. Yeah, it'll keep you from rolling over the edge if you fell but the following section felt like the downclimb at a gym and the anchors are just out of sight.

We also each brought a pair of gloves for descending the cables, which was excellent beta - it would have been much colder and more painful without them.   On P1, I led up to the right side of the ""roof"" by scrambling up the slab, put a piece in (on very long extended slings), and then downclimbed a ways before traversing left and back up to the roof.

I always come to MP to read the comments before I head to places and generally get good information but I feel like many of the comments below are misleading.  First off, the route was fantastic!  I loved every bit of it and the description as far as the climbing goes was spot on.  More than a few times in the past people have asked about doing the trip as an over-nighter and almost everyone votes against it, saying that Little Yosemite is WAY out of the way (some people even posted it was an hour out of the way) and that you have to carry way too much gear if you're camping.  My wife and I were trying to take it fairly easy while out in Yosemite (she's in the early stages of pregnancy and super tired all the time) so we opted for an over-nighter despite what I read below.  There are two options for this:  the snake dike bivy or Little Yosemite Valley.  The Snake Dike Bivy isn't talked about much and you can't get it ahead of time, only walk up, but the rangers said its always available because not many people know about it.  This was basically created because climbers were getting LYV permits and then camping up near the base of the route.  You have to carry bear canisters to camp there.  We chose LYV so we didn't have to carry a bear canister.  The campground for backpackers is AT MOST a 15 minute walk past the climbers trail for Snake Dike.  We literally walked from the top of Nevada Falls to camp in 20 minutes.  We left the valley floor around lunchtime and cruised slow up to camp and still had plenty of time to swim, filter water, chill out, and cook dinner before dark.  We woke up at 5:30 am, left camp by 6 with one small pack wearing our harnesses, and were first on the route by 8, with no one else showing up until 8:30.  It was super relaxed.  After climbing the route we walked back to camp and then down to the valley floor for pizza and beer.  On the way down we passed two other groups that had climbed Snake Dike behind us that were miserable and said they were over the hike and wish they wouldn't have tried it in a day.  So I say all of that just to say, if you are thinking about doing it as a two day trip GO FOR IT.  It is definitely a valid option for people that are slower.  Can it be done in one day?  Most definitely.  Probably even quite easily for many people, but that doesn't mean it isn't still an enjoyable experience doing it other ways.     A few other notes that I think are helpful.     After leaving Lost Lake we followed the trail to top of the hill where a few different approach trails split.  Everyone pretty much told us to head straight for the base of Half Dome from here and then traverse the slabs.  This definitely seems like the best way to do it.  The trail up the gully as well as the traverse on the slabs has been (somewhat) recently wrecked by a big rock slide.  It's a little ominous walking up through the splintered trees and gruss and dust covering everything, but it does make the bushwhacking quite easy and the path is fairly open.  The rocks are still super unstable and haven't settled yet so be careful here.   The bolts on the first couple of pitches are definitely bomber and have little ASCA tags on many of them with a date when they were replaced, but the upper pitches (both protection and anchors) have spinners and bolts that have backed out a bit on every single one.  They are not confidence inspiring.  The climbing is easy so I guess there's not much to worry about, but the comments and descriptions would have you believe that the bolts that are there are all bomber and newer.       Those are the few things that surprised me the most so I just wanted to mention them in case they are helpful to others.  Definitely not any reason to not do the route.  It is an amazing feature on Half Dome and such a cool summit.  I'll definitely do it again!  ","Little Rock, Arkansas",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"May 15, 2018"

Here are my thoughts:   Approach: Daniel Evans describes it well in his comment.  We took the mist trail and went between Liberty Cap and Mt. Broderick.  Approach took us about 3- 3.5 hrs, with my partner having come from 3ft below sea level in New Orleans.  If you do any type of hiking/ backpacking in the mountains, the approach is not that big a deal (though I am still feeling the 1000 ft of slabs in my calves.)   Gear:  .4- #1 Camalot, doubles in .5 and .75, 6 alpine draws, two cordalette anchors.  If you want more than a 2 piece anchor at the top of the last 2 pitches you will want doubles in those sizes.  Carried a selection of nuts, never placed any.   Route: We did the alternate start for pitch one, climbing the left side by the tree.  This was mellow and I would recommend it.  5.7 slab traverse on pitch 3 was very polished.  The belay at the top of the 3rd pitch is inaccurately represented on both the Supertopo and in the Sloan Guide.  There is not a belay station on left side of the dike, rather 2 bolts (one bomber, one crappy) one either side of the dike.  To utilizes these you will need a cord or an anchor longer than a standard double length sling.  I skipped this anchor looking for the actual station and ended up climbing to the next one.  This may require 5-6ft of simul-climbing with a 60m rope, depending on if you slung the new bolt above the pitch 2 belay or not.   Fixed gear: Above pitch 2, the bolts are garbage.  They appear to be 3/4 inch bolts, some heavily corroded, all with old SMC hangers.  Pretty much all the of the hangers were spinners and not flush with the wall.  You are already climbing a route with 80ft runouts- its a bummer to finish a pitch of that and then have to do a semi-hanging belay on shitty bolts.  The safety of the mid pitches is just a step above soloing.  If you are on this route you should already be climbing with a no fall mentality, but it is also not comforting to belay off those things, especially if you have multiple parties at a belay.  I understand that its a logistical pain in the ass to replace bolts on this route.  I encourage anyone who climbs in Yosemite to donate to the ASCA.    3rd class to summit: calf busters for sure.  We simul-climbed another 300ft or so with some gear just to make sure that we were out of anything overly exposed.  Approach shoes made this feel very comfortable.  After that, we coiled the rope and trudged.  It was tiring but didn't take that long.     Descent (with the cables down): We clipped in PAS's to the cables and just hand over hand climbed down- This was not a big deal with a harness and approach shoes. As has been noted, you would still get hurt in a fall with this method, but it does prevent a catastrophic fall.  The weight of the cables helps to plant your feet firmly flush to the wall.  We descended casually in under 10 minutes.  You could attach a prussik to the cables, as we only did about 4 change-overs, so that is not out of the question if you are worried about the descent.  Rappelling seems like it would take the longest and possibly wreck your rope, as it would be pulled over the cables at some point.   Water: Drank 1 liter on approach, and we both climbed with 2 each.  This allowed us to be hydrated enough to enjoy our lunches on the summit.  We filtered water after about 3.5 miles of the descent.   Summary: hardwear needs and upgrade, don't fall, and if ya'll are struggling on the approach or descent- get some sticky rubber shoes and do more cardio.  It is also hard for me to believe that people think the cables or the slabs are the scariest parts, in comparison to the climbing huge runouts with bolt hangers that would most certainly fail in a factor 2 fall- the other aspects are quite tame.

Contour left around liberty cap, into the gully. This is apparently pretty straightforward, as you are in a gully with steep walls on either side. You basically just need to keep going until you can escape to the left (Northish) which would putyou near lost lake. Though we did not use this beta, the people we talked to said it was very easy.    2. Contour right along liberty cap, following the mist trail to the muir trail again, then up that. The trail will flatten, and after a while, you will see a very obvious climbers trail on the left with a very spiky cairn as of Nov 3, 2018. This trail will put you near lost lake as well, and from there:    Both approach beta's now aim more or less for the south of half dome, and follow large cairns. The 3rd class slabs are exposed in some places, but very secure. Clear evidence of a large-ish rockfall here, so be aware.    We chose the left (alternate) start and it is mellow friction on bullet granite to the roof. You can sling the tree easily, and this whole pitch takes about 5 minutes for the leader.    The ""missing"" third pitch anchor mentioned so many times is actually still there- it is just below you when you finish the friction traverse on pitch 3. As you cross over to the larger of the 2 branches of the true snake dike, look down. It is right there, with a red sling. However, it would be pretty insane to clip this and keep climbing. Once you hit the dike, you are in jug city, just run it out. The Two bolts that are ""too far apart"" straddling the dike are in fine condition, just use a long sling to extend the anchor to a reasonable angle.    The run outs on this climb start in earnest above this point (end of 3) but the climbing is ridiculously secure. Without exaggerating too much, the most likely way for you to fall at this point would be if you turned around and leapt off.    The slabs on top are really nothing to be worried about, except that they take forever and are cardio hell. They are low enough angle that you can just walk up them... there is no route finding involved, and comments otherwise are very confusing... you just keep going up. Not really sure how you can mess that up. I think most people start this part up near the huge broken tectonic-plate like formations at the top of pitch 8.

Fwiw, just the mist trail to the SD turnoff is 4.2, plus another couple to the base of SD.   Side note, slings/QD's are light and easy to carry, bring 10 + 6 spare biners (I usually bring 8qd's, 1- 120cm, and 3-60cm alpines) and you can do the entire route without regrouping - also, for some it will be nice to simul on a 70m - can also be done easily enough on a 60 but often the 70 will allow 4 bolts between climbers, instead of 3, making some feel more comfortable on simul.   Several comments above suggest not doing the initial traverse on P1... ok, but did you really do the route if you skipped the hardest part? It won't kill you and you'll be glad you did. Everything else is cake after only 8ft of traversing.   Also, I highly suggest skipping the first bolt on the dike after the P3 traverse (w/ the tat masterpoint), and instead climbing 30-40ft up to the next bolt, this significantly mitigates swing potential for your follower and reduces a ton of rope drag.   Finally, if you bring a water filter, you can grab water about 3mi down from the top, so 2L or less will get you there, even in warm weather...provided you wake up in time and don't wait in a conga line.

I was skeptical, but a friction hitch on the cables using a Dyneema/Spectra sling DOES work.

Climbing was not hard but the 5.7 traverse at start of p3 to get to the dike and the endless slabs at the top sketched me out. Everything took us longer than expected. Thought 3.5 hours for approach; used 4.5 hours (went up JMT instead of Mist Trail, adding 1.2mi). Expected 2 parties ahead of us at start, actually waited 2 hours for 5 parties ahead of us to start. Hoped for 30 minutes/pitch but actually used 45 min/pitch (slow anchor building and belay changovers). Thought we'd do the ""endless slabs"" in 45 minutes but we were so tired and unacclimated to 8000'+ altitude that took us 2 hours from finishing p8 to reaching the very top (we kept stopping on the slabs to sit down and rest).    Other thoughts:   1) Had water filter but didn't refill at Merced river--a mistake. Started p1 with 1.7L for me and 1.5L for Eric and both and ran out on top, had to hike down thirsty for 3 miles. Given the weather (55-70F, sometimes windy) we should have started p1 with 2.3L for me and 2L for my partner (I sweat more).   2) LYV has a nice outhouse building (bathrooms on 2nd floor) and supposedly a water tap at the Ranger station, which we never found, so after wandering around a bit we went across the campground to filter river water.    3) If you've never hiked the HD trail, it's unmarked from bottom of the cables until half-way down subdome. From cables, hike NE straight over top of subdome then ENE down gentle slabs until you find the stone steps leading to switchbacks. When you hit junction of HD trai and JMT trail, turn right for Yosemite Valley.  4) We brought too much gear: 15 draws (only needed 6 alpine and 1 regular), 11 nuts and 3 tricams (didn't place except while fooling around on p1 roof start), 2 nut tools, 2 belay knives, 4 prusiks (only needed 2 prusiks), 3 anchor setups (only needed 2), 1 pair crack gloves, 3 extra sets of AAA batteries for the headlamps (only needed 2 extra sets), 4oz bug spray (only saw 1 mosquito), 3oz sunscreen (should have applied and left it in the car), 6 slings (only needed 2), 6 extra wiregates (only needed 2), 4 snack/protein bars for (3 would have been enough), etc.   5) After the optional belay station on p3, bailing would be difficult with just one rope, plus many anchors above the start of p4 don't have quicklinks or rap rings. The two parties ahead of us bailed, one from p3 using 2 ropes and the other from top of p1 with one rope (they downclimbed after rappeled to the end of their rope).    If I did it again, I would bring less gear and train a lot more beforehand on the uphill hiking--we underestimated the hiking and it kicked our butts.  I'd top off my water above Nevada Falls, where the trail sign says ""Last Water.) We should have taken the Mist trail uphill (shorter) and the JMT trail through Clark Point on the return (longer but less steep. That would have let us avoid descending hundreds (thousands?) of steps and getting sprayed by Vernal Fall at night (better to be sprayed in the morning while hiking uphill). And I would skip the prusik when descending the cables and just use 2 tethers plus gloves, especially if the cables were up. We had to wrap and unwrap our prusiks at least 6 times going down the cables even though only 2 support poles were up.  ","San Jose, CA",Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"May 26, 2021"

I did read through just about every comment here before the climb. For context, I am mostly a boulderer (V6/7ish) but very new to trad/multipitch. This was my 4th climb in Yosemite, so definitely somewhat inexperienced on this style and granite. I felt like some of the comments were totally different from my experience:   The weather:  We did it mid September, it was 85-90 degrees on the valley floor and around 70 degrees at the base of the climb. We started at 6am so we got to do a lot of the approach without direct sun. Hottest part was easily from the climbers junction up to the base of the climb, the exposed slabs were an absolute oven. I guess that's what we get for doing it in the late summer season. We had a great breeze all day which kept things cool and dry. Even though we did this on a Sunday we didn't see a single other person between the climbers trail junction and the peak. It was pretty special to have the entire wall to ourselves the full day.   The Hike/Water:  We knew it was going to suck since I am out of hiking shape and it very much did. I could see it being less of a suffer fest if you trained for it. Overall we spent about 10 hours hiking which was a bit more than expected, but again we didn't really prepare much. We brought minimal water up to the mist trail and filtered at the top of Nevada falls, meaning we never had to carry much water weight. However I drink a ton of water so I somehow managed to get through all 4 liters from the top of Nevada falls to the top of half dome (lol). We refilled at Nevada again on the way down, but went about 4 miles without water. I switched from hiking shoes to approach shoes and stashed my poles/filter/shoes at the junction with the climbers trail, it was a nice way to carry less weight and mix up the type of strain on the legs. Overall I'd recommend being in good hiking shape before attempting or you will suffer.   Gear:  We brought doubles of everything below #1 and 1 #1 cam. There's actually a lot of gear placements on the upper pitches which apparently nobody mentioned (every 20-30 feet or so) and we liked having the extra gear. I was a bit confused on the recommended rack, since both pitch 7 and pitch 8 need gear anchors, which would leave essentially no pro for the pitches. For pitch 8 I placed 4 pieces and barely had enough for an anchor, but hey maybe I just don't like running it out that much. I personally felt the extra gear was easily worth it...cams don't weigh that much. we brought 4 alpine draws and 2 normal draws, we wished we had 6 alpine and 2 normal. Make sure you bring gloves for the cables.   The Climb:  This took somewhere between 5-5.5 hours. We did the alternate tree start. Comments on here led us to believe it would be a walk in the park from the slung tree to the roof (a #1 was very solid pro here), but in our opinion this was easily the crux of the climb and was basically a guaranteed ground fall. For context, we found the 'crux' slab traverse on pitch 3 felt very easy, but for some reason this first runout from the tree just seemed a lot trickier and heady with the ground fall. I do think it was more about headspace than climbing difficulty, but still felt like the most challenging climbing of the route.   The climbing is easy, but a bit more tenuous than I was hoping (again, not super experienced with granite). Lots of options, but most of the dike is semi-slippery dishes. Just take your time to find the best feet and it will feel pretty good. I led pitch 2 (very fun), pitch 4 (the 70 foot runout was a bit WTF, essentially soloing at that point in my opinion), pitch 6 (I slung 3 mediocre knobs, the climbing was basically 5.2 at this point), and pitch 8 (really fun climbing, surprisingly). I didn't think I would fall, but I am a bit conservative with pro so it was more of a headspace battle. I'm super happy to have done it though, just make sure your head game is good before attempting or you might need to bail.    We expected pitch 7 and 8 to be trivial based on comments, but thought they were a good bit harder than the dike pitches. May have been slightly off route on these last two looking at the topo lines, I felt like they were both 5.6ish. Overall none of the climbing felt 5.7 to me, but a lot of the things labelled 5.4 or 5.3 in the topo did feel harder. Overall my thoughts on the grades:   P1: 5.6 R  P2: 5.3 R  P3: 5.5 R  P4: 5.4 X  P5: 5.5 R  P6: 5.2 R  P7: 5.5 R  P8: 5.6   If you have a similar experience/background to me this may be helpful in choosing which pitches to lead and which to follow.   The topout:  These took us a bit under 1.5 hours. The slabs after the climb were way sketchier than I expected. In many spots here you would almost certainly die if you slipped, since there isn't much to self-arrest on. Slipping is super unlikely due to the ease of the terrain, but the fact that it is was steeper than 45 degrees for the majority was spooky to me. We simulclimbed from the end of the 8th pitch to the top. it was barely slower than just walking unroped and there was plenty of pro every 50 feet or so. To be honest we needed the breaks anyways since it's at a pretty high elevation, it was much harder on the cardio for this section.  Again, falling is unlikely (you could literally jog up it safely if you were fit enough), but I just didn't feel comfortable climbing something like that without a rope. I think just do what makes you feel safe here.   The cables:  The cables were up when we did it, but I still find them sketchy. I can't believe so many hikers do this, the rock is absolutely polished! Maybe ignorance is bliss or maybe I should go down facing backwards so I can't see what's ahead haha.   Overall impression:  It was a tough, long day and I wish the bolts were in better condition since they are all quite loose (even the anchors) for those runouts. However, the experience was amazing and I loved it.  ",,Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"Sep 14, 2021"

One party at the top of 1st pitch when we arrived, another party arrived when we were at top of 4th. Summited half dome around 4-4:30, it was a ghost town, very cool considering how crowded the top can get! Not sure if due to the current Yosemite day pass lottery system/covid capacity requirements in the park, or if it was just late enough in the afternoon for most hikers to have already headed home, but it was awesome.    I attempted this climb in 2018 and didn't finish -- I read all comments on this page before that attempt, and my only note i'll say about that attempt is MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BAIL PLAN. My sister is my new partner and I had us haul a second rope this time around -- definitely led to extra fatigue/misery (especially when doing the Mist Trail on the way down), but worth it IMO so you don't get stuck having to call YOSAR if shit unexpectedly hits the fan a 6 mile hike up from the valley (we decided extra sweat to haul the extra rope we already owned was worth it rather than buying a brand new extra-skinny bail rope, but you may disagree). I know people do this climb in the dark, but I especially cant imagine hiking up the slabs in the pitch black. Just something to consider, to each their own.   Gear: I brought a single BD .3/.4, double BD .5 thru 1s, 4-5 small-medium nuts, and felt like everything was used at least once.  4 alpines, 1 quad length alpine (useful for tree sling, and some upper pitch placements), 6 quickdraws (probably only used 4 max ever before regrouping, including for redirecting the belay). There's plenty of gear placements on pitch 7+8, not sure why you'd VOLUNTARILY make them R rated after finishing all the R rated pitches below :) Alex Pfiffner's comments right above about gear usage/gear anchors is spot on.   Pitch 4 is the headiest IMO despite the crux technically being a single traverse move on pitch 3 -- the dike just seems to keep going, your last bolt farther and farther away. After that, the pitches get progressively shorter, or ladder-like secure (pitch 6), or with chicken heads to sling (pitch 5) or just genuine gear placements (7+8).    Took 16.25 hours Curry Village to Curry Village -- started walking at 4:30 am, and got back at 8:45 just in time to order pizza and beer while we hobbled around on dead feet. Had to wait a couple times for the follower ahead of us to start up off the anchor, but never for a huge amount of time. My sister and I are in decent shape, albeit at sea level -- just know the day is LONG. We brought a super small water filter, and its 1000% worth it. The slabs are pretty brutal after the climb, we bear crawled in our climbing shoes probably the first 50% of the way up since losing our balance with heavy packs and tired legs seemed not completely out of the question. Didn't take climbing shoes off till we reached the cairns marking the summit. We both admitted later that the ""scariest"" part of the day for us was realizing if the other one slipped on this section, we wouldn't be able to help. Simple via-ferrata type strategy for cables down, no big deal.   Once we hit top of Nevada Falls on the hike down, the remaining 3-4 miles just seemed to stretch on forever. Mist trail magically added what felt like 500 extra steps since the morning we walked up them, and the lower pavement section stretched on for an extra eternity.

Having done the approach both ways (Broderick shortcut vs. trail to Little Yosemite) I'm not convinced there is any significant time savings on the short cut, though the gap route is a little more interesting. If you don't find the carin for the cut off, don't sweat it, just take the trail up toward little Yosemite and pop over the hill to lost lake.  For route details see Kim Svatos' spot on beta in these comments.  Gear: 6 cams (small to #1 BD), no nuts, 4 single slings, a double length sling, and a triple length sling (which I used twice), 6 draws.   If you're dehydrated as one our team was you can get water at Sunrise Creek .5 mile past the junction of JMT and Half Dome Trail. The trail doesn't cross Sunrise creek but if you listen for it to the east (left as you're hiking down) you can find it. Or go a little further down toward Little Yosemite and get to a spring. Ideal if you have a life straw.    The technical crux for us was for sure the 5.7 traverse/undercling on the first pitch. Can't really undercling so you just have to smear and trust your feet. You get a .75 at the end of the traverse. Sling it long to mitigate rope drag.   We did the optional belay anchor/stance at pitch 3 because our friends were occupying the the belay anchor on the dike. It's off to the right of the dike about 10'. It's a great belay stance with good bolts but it was a little sketchy getting over there.  ",Arroyo Grande,Yosemite Valley,105836362,5.7,beginner,"May 25, 2022"

But tl;dr you’ll be fine with a 60, and there’s no need to do a very short pitch to avoid running out of rope.   There are 2 things that look like they might be the p3 anchors:  1. A pair of new bolts, 10’ to the right of the dike on a tiny ledge. Overall, this seems like the better option for a p3 belay. But I am not sure whether a 50m rope would reach from here to p4, or easy it is to traverse those 10’ off the dike, 60’ above your last pro. Or maybe this is a belay for Eye in the Sky.  2. A new bolt on the left and an old buttonhead on the right of the dike, 4’ apart from each other, 10’ above option #1. The 2 bolts are far enough apart that we had to make a rope anchor to have enough material. It’s such a weird setup that I doubt it’s meant to be an anchor. It created more rope drag compared to option #1 because the dike curves rightward in p4.    Supertopo shows a 2-bolt anchor on the left of the dike on top of p3. But this either does not exist, or it represents the weird dike-straddling anchor.   We used option #2 and had ~40ft of rope left on a 60m at the end of p4. Option #1 would definitely work with a 60 as well, and probably with a 50.   I have made a corrected topo but can't upload it to MP due to copyright warnings.

There are not enough bolts. That being said, Tristan is right – if you can onsight solo a 5.4 then the odds are you will be totally fine on this route. But I would *absolutely* recommend doing your homework and intimately understanding the beta, the protection places (thanks N Kalli!), and the risks *before* you go. Anna fell because she went past some anchor bolts and then down climbed, and to me that is the true risk here. Don't miss the anchors, and don't go the wrong way (only really possible at the very start of pitch 3; remember to go LEFT, NOT up!!).   Anyway, here's a trip report:  • 3:30 AM wakeup at Upper Pines  • Carbo loaded, then hit the Mist Trail trailhead around 4:15 AM.  • Hiked by headlamp. The hike isn't too long, but the beginning especially was *exhausting*. You're looking at like 6 miles and 3000 feet of elevation gain, most of it front-loaded. But you're going up stairs, so it's not difficult other than cardio.  • Reached the base of the climb around 7:30 (3h15m total time). That was a solid pace but with plenty of resting – I'm not sure where the 5 hour estimates come from unless you have a picnic.  • There was nobody else there. Took the alternate start just before 8:00 AM and up we went. Other people showed up by the time we were on pitch 3, and that seemed to be the beginning of a conga line. So arrive before 8 if you want to be first. Sunrise was incredible and the weather was absolutely perfect.  • Finished the climb around 11:45 AM. Took longer than expected – we kept stopping to double check we were still on route, and even with doing that had some confusion at various points. Most notably, we accidentally went the wrong way on pitch 7, but by the time you get there it's basically choose your own adventure and our way was plenty doable. Had to simul for about 10 feet to reach a trad anchor point.  • Took a lunch break, then hit the slabs. OMG those slabs. I really did not enjoy it. They just seemed to go on forever. It took us about 90 minutes to hit the top. I was gassed by this point from low sleep and needed to take many rests.  • Hung out at the summit for awhile and then took the (dropped) cables down with a prussik and locking biner on a sling. I really would not bother with the prussik in hindsight. It's easy enough to hand-over-hand, and having to squat awkwardly to move the prussik along was super annoying and tiring. That being said, with only a biner on a sling, if you fell at just the wrong time you will tumble very far and there's a good chance your non-dynamic sling would snap from the force. So.... your choice.  • Hiked back. Got back by 4:30 PM. Gorged on pizza and beer.  • Overall length was about 12.5 hours.   I am quite an experienced trad climber, but I never really push grades that hard (more an adventure climber), and I found this climb extremely easy and fun. I'd say in the gym I project 5.12s, in Yosemite 5.9s. Compared to many other routes in the valley, I would even rate this something like a 5.5. The blank slab traverse crux at the start of pitch 3 was the single hardest part but it wasn't difficult – just need to move slowly and be careful with feet. Then pretty much the entire rest of the climb is just a ladder. But the run outs, oh my! They were a lot. As others said, I just had to climb like I was free soloing and not expect to place any pro. For that reason, I might even recommend folks free solo a few things (for example I solo'd Tenaya before this) to get the head game right.

To anyone who doesn't have much slab climbing experience and wants to jump on this route, I highly recommend setting aside a day or two before hand to go practice some true no handholds slab climbing and really start to learn the technique and what your shoes can actually handle. Based on all the comments I was expecting to find slick glacial polished slab with heady smearing. Instead I thought the rock was highly textured and super grippy, with all the slab climbing quite easy and secure. I didn't think there was any mandatory 5.7 moves on this route, especially not by older grading standards. I consider myself someone who gets scared easily in dangerous climbing situations and I never felt concerned while climbing on the dike, all very secure and a decent amount of pro during the short 5.5 section. I do highly recommend bringing a 70 meter rope unless you are confident in finding the belay stations and don't want to link pitches. I linked pitches 4/5 and 7/8 and thought that made for a much more enjoyable climb. Linking pitch 4/5 left me with about 10ft of rope and 7/8 took every inch. As strange as it sounds for such a direct route, I saw multiple people miss bolts/belays and wind up at alternate belays where they may have had to down climb with a shorter rope, guess its easy to not look around when you are so focused on the climbing in front of you.   I thought the topo on pitch 7/8 was a little confusing but the MP description is spot on. You want to head just a little right up the slab a short ways into the right facing flake, then when you get to the roof head left and find a good spot to pull over onto the slab that will take you up to a bunch of stacked blocks. Wished I had some bigger cams to belay here but was still able to make do with a couple .3's and a .4. Don't take the arching roof crack to the right at the top of pitch 7, I thought this was maybe the 5.2 fingers but it was a lot tougher than that and led to a crux down climb when I realized it went nowhere.    I thought the 3rd class hiking, while a workout, was very secure, no way you are gonna slip and tumble down the whole way. there are a couple fifth class moves getting over some ledges, so you may want to give less experienced climbers a spot or a hand getting over them.   We descended with the cables down, and I thought it was a really mellow and fun descent without using prusiks, great friction the whole way down, just head down backwards. The crux of the descent was the crowds. Be prepared for tons of people on a weekend, creating huge traffic jams at the cable changeovers while they reattach their prusiks. We ultimately had to just clip around people and jump between the left and right cables to get down, there were people stuck on that descent for an hour plus waiting at the changeovers.

I like that the description balances explaining that while it is the easiest route on El Cap, which is true, it is still fairly complicated (the success rate as of 2019 is around 40%). If you are under 120 lbs / 55 Kg, and are not adept at mountaineering style ascents with talus and third and fourth class terrain (there are fixed ropes, but it is still very strenuous with a pack), this route might be more difficult than the Nose - the aiding is more difficult than the Nose, it is lower-angled so the bolts are very, very reachy so slower and difficult for shorter folks, and just getting all your stuff up to the route is pretty stout. That said, if you climb in backcountry trad areas regularly, can hike around decently with a heavy pack, then LF will be easier than the Nose and super fun.     This route is definitely not popular to rappel, don't know where that info came from. (It is possible for light, in-a-day teams to rap, but most are so cooked at the end they find the 1.5 hr walk down way easier and faster). We should just say that this route is set up with rappel anchors (a dedicated rap route takes you from Thanksgiving Ledge, straight back down to the route, avoiding the upper, wandry climbing).    The release of The Pod in November 2019 from G7, the world's first inflatable portaledge / inflatable sleeping pad combo, will change the logistical challenges of Lurking Fear greatly (email me if you want to borrow / rent my inflatable ledges). Basically, most teams need a portaledge only for their first night on the wall, and the extra work required to get the portaledge all the way up to the route, and haul it up the route, really wears folks out.    Folks email me with questions about the bivy ledge mid route a fair bit, so thought I would answer here. The ledge at 9.5 is only good for one, but with an inflatable ledge would be palatial. Also, it is not possible to climb to the bivy ledge and then 'lower out' back on to the route, and climb pitch 10; the best you can do with this scenario is leave your haulbag at the anchor at the ledge, both climbers rappel down to the Pillar of Despair, belay 9, then you climb pitch 10 like normal........except that the leader has to wait to haul. After the cleaner has cleaned pitch 10 they will just rappel down to the ledge anchor, attach the haul line to the haul bag, and release the haul bag. I've included a pic to show you all this (look in the photo gallery for the pic titled 'overlay of mid route ledge').   Here are some more thoughts on 'getting to the ledge,' etc.   A couple factors are in play - one major one being that pitch 10 is one of the harder pitches on the route, so that slows things down considerable (then pitch 11 is the crux so def not good to plan on doing that before bivying, as you would be likely to run out of time).   When I climbed the route the first time I used this strategy:  1. I led pitch 10, hauled the bag up a little ways, but it was still a few meters below the elevation of the ledge.  2. My partner cleaned the pitch, like normal, but instead of clipping into the anchor they just handed me the gear sling they had just cleaned, pulled their grigri tight, and then rapped down to the bag.  3. They 'walked' the bag over to the ledge, and anchored it there.  4. They also anchored the lead line  5. I rapped down the lead line to the ledge, leaving the hauler all set up  6. In the morning, I jugged up first and started to haul (shows why it is important to pull up 4 - 5 meters of slack before fixing the lead line, so you have this as a tie in while you're hauling. When you jug back up in the morning, you just tie back into the rope, and you're all ready to start hauling safely).  7. My partner released the haul bag  8. My partner jugged the lead line also, lowering out off the anchor on the ledge (careful to not get twisted up with the bag / haul line).   Now with the new inflatable portaledge it will not be so important to reach the ledge; Pillar of Despair might be fine if you get there in the dark and don't want to deal with all this stuff (likely ;). The coolest thing about the inflatable portaledges is they are also a 4"" sleeping pad. That's right baby, 4 inch base camp pad on the Big Stone!

A stiffy quickdraw makes a lot of the ladders go faster/easier. (Long QD with coat hanger wire taped to make it stiff.)   The haul to P14 is annoying. The leader needs to make sure the haul line doesn't get wrapped up in the chimney or something. The pitch goes quite a bit to the left.

We rapped off of some jingus slung flake for the second rap. Strange. I really don't think we missed anything.    -the Sloan guide says use a single 60 for the first 5 chimney rappels. That is BS. You need two ropes to make the final station on rap #5 on the slab just below the chimney to take you to the ground.   -The chimney is the most likely place for you to get killed: loose rocks everywhere    Great stuff!

I didn't find any of the rapping devious or tricky to find anchors in the chimney/gulley system. In the daylight it seemed very straight-forward. On the final rappels down the steep blank wall that take you to the ground there are a few newer looking anchors that make the single 60m rope work. I think a 70 meter rope would eliminate the need to down climb the one section of 4th/5th class.    Route Notes: Hooks used - one big grappling, one medium camhook. Didn't hand place any beaks.

But I suppose the exposure and classic bivy ledges make up for it all.   I concur with the advice of linking 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9. Older topos note ""fixed"" sections of A1 and ""bad"" bolts. None of that is true today. Almost every bolt has been replaced. Most of the fixed sections aren't, at least until reaching a slew of pitons near the top. What was A1 pins is now C2 camming in pin scars. You'll want two sets of Aliens and/or Totems or similar. Three sets is better if you are going to link pitches. We needed nothing larger than a #3 Camalot.   Our descent via the Leaning Tower Chimney took 9 or 10 raps, all from good anchors, along with two short sections of class 3/4 downclimbing. After a single-rope rap from the summit ridge to a good tree, a 60m rap reaches to within a few feet of the ground (3rd class to reach terra firma). All the raps in the Chimney are from bolted anchors and less than 30m in length, the first two of which are vertical or overhanging. As you exit the Chimney and move a few feet to climbers right, break out a second rope (if you have one) for a 55m rap to the ground. Intermediate anchors exist to break the the two longer raps for those with only one rope. There is some loose rock in the Chimney. The descent could take 4+ hours to reach the parking lot. Probably not something to try for the first time by headlamp. Bivy ledges don't get better than the one at the top of Pitch 10.  ","Portland, OR",Yosemite Valley,106187777,5.7,beginner,"Jul 5, 2020"

We had two sets of Totems, a set of regular cams (mix of aliens and Metolius ultralight master cams) five offset cams, two #3 camalots, two #4 Camalots, a full set of offset nuts from micro to the largest DMM, and regular nuts. Aid gear, we had camhooks, a few beaks of various sizes, a grappling hook and a talon (had a cliff hanger too but that got dropped on the first pitch).   I led pitches 1, 2, 4 and 8 as listed in the Sloan book, and my pal Julian had the others.    I was glad I had two 4’s for the last pitch. Used both.   The totems were clutch. Fit everywhere we placed them. Neither of us took a single lead whip the whole time.   For anyone who can do this route without hooks, kudos to you. I had to use a beak and the grappling hook just to get through the C2 section on the first pitch. Wasn’t til afterwards that I re-read a comment here to the effect of “ignore the fixed nut to the left of the first bolt ladder; it goes nowhere.” I clipped it, pulled up to it, and then had to use the beak to be able to reach the hook placement. After that was able to get another totem in and it was over. But that was a funky tricky section.   I also used the beak and the hook again on the fourth pitch right off Guano Ledge. There are several blown heads that the beak works great with. Definitely recommend bringing at least one, probably a mid-size pecker, not the larger tomahawks.   I never placed any of the offset cams we brought, nor did I use the camhooks or the talon, and I sewed up the pitches I led. My partner and I both wound up using the totems so much that we were able to get plenty of regular cams and (usually offset) nuts in for each pitch, so the offset cams were unnecessary, as long as you have two sets of totems.    Also definitely agree this is not really a beginner route so to speak. Though there is a ton of C1 there’s plenty of hooking, C2 and spicy free moves you need to pull, and you need to know how to do a lower-out for following in a few spots. We did it in two days, taking our time. Climbed to Ahwahnee Ledge, left the haul bag, fixed pitches four and five, spent the night on the ledge, then jugged up and did the final three and had plenty of daylight for the descent.    On the seventh pitch, we had to leave a fixed Metolius 0 right after the last bolt in the roof. Thing would not budge when I tried to clean it. If you can booty it, enjoy. Just the latest in a ton of fixed pieces all over the route. There were several biners and slings clipped to various pitons and other fixed nuts, heads and the like, on nearly every pitch.   Fantastic time. Definitely recommend it. For those on here who say it's less than classic, you must be pretty damn spoiled. Perhaps the most amusing part was my pal dropped his FitBit watch off while leading pitch 7, and got it back because some kind soul found it and placed it obviously on a rock in the middle of the trail heading down. Had a cracked face but worked just fine. Damnedest thing.  ","Denver, CO",Yosemite Valley,106187777,5.7,beginner,"Jun 13, 2021"

I stupidly took a nasty tumbling fall down a gully on 4/19/12 after the climb, and would love to get these back to offset the pain of my substantial injuries.   Note that P1 and P3 were still a bit wet on 4/19/12, but given the good hand holds didn't preclude climbing (I wiped off my feet a few times after they touched wet spots).   For reference on my review, I'm 6', a 5.7/5.8 leader, and have about 100 pitches of trad under my belt all-time.   P1 is a sustained, somewhat pumpy lieback experience, but the pro is generally very good and much of it can be foot-jammed for partial rests.   P2 is an easy ramp walk-up to a great belay ledge, 5.-   P3 features epic exposure with a great crack system.  1st step right is no problem at all at my height, as you can do it statically.  Might feel more adventurous if you are about 5.8 or shorter.  Don't expect too many hand jams here, but feet will get in there a lot and the face/crack junction features serve as good hands.   P4/P5 were a bit unclear to me - we just about maxed out P3 with a 60m rope, then I found myself with options of either setting up a tree belay in the mossy face area, or a gear belay at the top of the P3 crack system under a little roof.  I chose the latter (which was fine), though if you don't surmount the roof from there, you'll need to execute a sketchy leftward traverse with no pro for a couple moves after the belay (definitely clip your belay anchors beforehand).  We went left here because SuperTopo indicated there were both left and right options, and the right option featured 5.8 friction moves over a bulge, which I wasn't excited about at the time.   After this, I lied back the left-facing mossy corner system for a bit before getting up and over the corner back onto the face right.  From here, there's a pumpy but well-protected roof move (perhaps this was the famous ""mantle""?  If so, why was there no clear mention that is was also a roof move in the SuperTopo?) that can be surmounted if you're taller by reaching up on top of the roof for bomber holds on the right.  If you're shorter, you may find this roof more exhausting.   After said roof, there were several good belay options, followed by a short romp to the top of the formation.   I'm pretty sure I missed something with the intended P4/P5, as SuperTopo didn't mention a P4/P5 roof move and I'm not sure where exactly the ""crux mantle"" move was supposed to be.

We were 2nd in line, but as we moved up we saw we were 4th in line from the 5.7 3rd pitch belay ledge. Waited a couple hours to get moving... Weather was perfect, no breeze in the evening. Warm night for the most part. No clouds.   Pitch 1: 5.9 Finger crack w/excellent smeared right feet, and left toe nubs in the crack. Difficult move is about 10 feet above the standing ledge, then it pushes a hard 4-8m  of small +/- 2 finger locks giving way to hand jams and a clean finish. Belay at the Tree, but don't spend too much time there.   Pitch 2: 5.6 Chimney-Esque? Well, I mostly walked up the low angle, then did a lay back for the chimney section. You could get a 3 in under the flake to protect it, or you could just push through 10 ft to some great jugs. I dont think I protected it much other than a .75 about 3m. up... very short.   Pitch 3: 5.7 Hand Crack w/small finger locks and some stemming. Things get a little more vertical here for the 1/2 then you'll reach the belay ledge below the next pitch. Highly exposed, but it's all there. Used lots of c3's 1.s and .75.s if I remember - Otherwise nuts all day.   Sun starting to Set here and the darkness is creeping in.   Pitch 4. Shoot right and around, then back left across a face traverse. There is protection on a crack that shoots up before the traverse.. after the traverse head up thing crack with great feet. I set up a belay under the ledge and before the bulge which reminds me of double cross in JTree. I had some rope drag because I may have over protected the traverse not knowing how it was going to unfold. Also, I didn't see a tree.. maybe I didn't go far enough over.   Night Fall w/Headlamp - Definitely Awesome Climbing!   Pitch 5: I hopped over the bulge and climbed all the way to the bottom of the crux mantle area. I don't remember much of this, but great feet and stable hands. Definitely enjoyable and exciting in the dark. Feet are really able to smear on the rock from the angle. Set up an anchor at the bottom left of the crux move area. There is a small ledge 3m bottom right diagonal where I through in some 3's and even a 4.   Pitch 6: Set a couple cams in the undercling area, and a couple nuts in the left crux crack pocket. A nice x4 will also fit half way up. High hands, high right foot, stem left, and reach for two left sided nubs, one near and one far and beach yourself on that ledge. Nuts can go in the left side, or skip and move right about 3m of face to the crack.. and it's pretty much clear from there... up another 30m or so.. I was pretty beat, and my partner wanted to lead a pitch early but wasn't up for it.. I set the gear for the crux and her 5.2 60kg frame flew right up it. Its probably the easiest of the 5.8 pitches. Felt easier than the 5.7 earlier.   Descent: Left gully has wrap Rap wring about 10 m down. Rap to the deck, then scramble down.. scramble right when you dont think you can go any further and you'll run into a trail that will take you down some rocks and dirt. It's well defined. From there you can walk home.   We finished this route about 1130 PM in the full moon light. It was one of the best experiences I've had. The descent down can be pretty long 1+ hour so add that in the total climb time. We didn't get back until about 115 or so..    Also, my partner left some of my nuts in the route on 9-17. She didn't have a head lamp and couldnt pull them. Maybe 2-3 if she told me right. please email me at joeytolle at gmail.com respond here.    Another great Yosemite trip!

Quick pitch-by-pitch:   P1: Maybe the technical crux for me? The last 20' of the lieback and pulling around the corner at its top are fairly tricky. Purple camalots are your friend.    P2: Cakewalk, basically walking up a ramp. Could probably be combined with P1 if you don't mind pulling a ton of rope drag.   P3: Kinda scrappy TBH. We found a seep coming out of the main route along the upper ~20', with slimy moss in the crack which made both climbing and protecting it pretty tricky.    P4: Harder than the infamous mantle. Slabby runout from the belay, then a bulge mid-route that is very protectable but somewhat tricky. The rest is balancy shallow cracks up the slab.   P5: The mantle. Grab the jug, throw your right foot up high onto the shelf and pull it. Really not bad, especially if (like me) you're more comfortable with face holds than crack climbing.

We were lucky to start early at 8:30am with not a soul in sight, and somehow managed to have the route to ourselves the entire time on the wall. The end of the first pitch had a tiny bit of water running down the left side of the belay, but not enough to wet our shoes or the rope to any noticeable degree. The rest of the climb was totally dry, in addition to the perfect spring weather.   This was my first full 5.8 multipitch lead and I must admit that almost all pitches (aside from P2) were pretty heady! I lead every pitch, and as a budding 5.8/5.9 leader (having led roughly ten 5.8 pitches and five 5.9 pitches), I felt like this was at my mental limit. The bulge and the mantel look more difficult than they are, and most of the face climbing feels spicier than it is. Most of the climb has awesome exposure, and most every pitch offered varied crack and face climbing that put me in a state of constant focus. I found every pitch to be quite enjoyably protectable, with near obvious gear placement every 10-15ft as you get higher on the route; only once or twice did I find myself in a rest well above my previous piece without any obvious placement before me. This climb eats nuts, but also accepts cams if you keep an eye out for the parallel cracks. It was my wife's first valley 5.8 multipitch (with only a single 5.8 follow the day previous) so she struggled with several pitches, asking for a few takes in order to rest briefly or to work on a difficult nut. There is a single true ledge belay (top of P2, after an easy jaunt up a 5.4 ramp) and the rest are semi-hanging, so expect some slight harness/shoe discomfort if you're just breaking into multipitching; however, the climbing is amazing and well worth it! Overall, my wife and I had an amazing day on the The Nutcracker, taking 5hrs from base to summit and eating a well deserved lunch at the top while taking in the beautiful Yosemite views and enjoying the heavenly weather.   The descent is mostly straightforward, fun, 5th class down-scrambling for a bit until you come to an obvious steep, rocky, switchbacked dirt climber's trail; easily follow the path back to the picnic area parking lot.    If interested, here are my comments on each pitch:  P1) 5.8 lieback that gets a bit more left leaning and more secure as you get to the top; the mental crux for me was gaining the lieback position and the first few moves after. After pulling up and over to the final section, easier 5.5/5.6 section, belay at the base of the 5.4 ramp. This pitch might be the crux if you lack solid lieback/corner crack skills.  P2) An easy scramble up a 5.4 ramp to a beautiful, large, reassuring belay ledge (we belayed from the existing natural rock anchor comprising nylon runners)  P3) An exposed step to the right to gain a sequence of arcing finger/hand cracks that you can lieback or finger jam with good feet until you traverse to a wider crack on the left up to a gear belay. I used 2 large nuts and a #1, positioned slightly past am obvious natural rappel anchor, underneath a roof like feature that you climb up the right side of to begin the next pitch.  P4) Climb right around the bulge/roof like feature and then to the left with some heady face climbing to the actual ""bulge"" marked in the topos. The bulge has a 5.8 splitter hand crack in it, so just focus on getting high feet on the bulge face or foot jamming the crack and sink those jams to pull up and over to a fun, longer wide finger crack leading up to the final, slabby, featured, belay position.  P5) Climb up and left on a featured slab to a large bulge feature and gain the crack system in a semi-left facing corner for a few moves until you perform the infamous mantel move! Get high feet and pull on some jugs on the top, and there's a nice little ledge to rest on before tackling the airy face climb to gain another wide, slabby finger crack all the way to the top. Just follow the path of least resistance and you'll find good but likely unnecessary pro all the way straight to the top. I belayed from natural anchors at the top, and extended the anchor so I could see my wife as she victoriously finished this fun and challenging Yosemite classic.

We warmed up on Keystone Corner on Wednesday, July 22, 2020, and while it does look like someone bolted the anchor within the last year or so, I was able to pull one of the three out with my bare hands.  The hanger on said bolt also had a deep cut in it, almost as if someone took a grinding wheel to it.  It never should have been used on a bolt to begin with.  The bolts used are 9mm euro-style steel expansion bolts with Metolius hangers, but whoever installed them didn't tighten the hanger on enough to engage the expansion sleeve.  It looked as though they only hand-tightened the nut and then placed a drop of bolting glue on the end of the nut/bolt to keep it from unscrewing.  They may have also drilled a 3/8"" hole for the 9mm bolt.  The rightmost of the three bolts seems okay upon initial inspection, but the left is somewhat loose and the middle came out with only a few tugs with my bare hand.  This anchor is not safe, period, especially when you consider this is a trade route that sees a lot of novice climbers running toprope laps up it.  I'll post a photo of the hanger in the photo section for the route.  I'll also post on the bolt replacement threads.  If anyone has any information on who put these in, please reach out to me.  I have no intentions of putting them on public blast.  I would rather give them the chance to reeducate on bolting before they do it again.

For reference, I'm 6' and a solid 5.7/5.8 leader with about 100 pitches of trad under my belt all-time.   Definitely felt like the crux was the leftward traverse on P1.  Analyze where your pro will be on this section ahead of time, as it's a critical spot to protect you and your follower and there aren't a ton of placement options.  Climbing this in April, though our route was dry, the friction feet were still not 100% dry on the rock, making this section feel committing.  That said, I committed and had no problem getting through it traversing hands on the small crack and using friction feet on the face.  I later saw another climber put feet in the crack and use undercling hands in the same crack as well for this part, which looks like it might have felt easier (though probably would have made the pro more awkward).   After the traverse on P1, if you've got big hands you'll be treated to an all-too-short splitter crack, followed by the aforementioned tree belay (good idea).   For P2, I found the roof move right above the tree to be easy with my big hand jams, but my 5'2"" female partner with small hands had quite a bit more difficulty with it.

Try to avoid it.  - Pitch 10 is pretty long and wandering. What I did to avoid the haulbag eating flake: I climbed all the pitch at once. Then I build a middle hauling anchor just before the ledge on the middle of the pitch (left of the eating flake). I hauled from there then I hauled a second time from the top. This avoid quite nicely the eating flake.  -To start pitch 11, Don't go directly left!!

You will gain a large obvious trail that heads up the gully between Higher Cathedral Rock and The Spires. Use this trail for any routes on Higher Cathedral Rock or Spire. I lead the first four pitches and there was a good amount of runout on some of the face parts and the large gear I plugged into the corner system was questionable at times. The fourth crux pitch felt 5.9 to me but I was kinda tired and not using the best technique at the moment. I was able to get good gear in the corner on the fourth pitch though (two #4 and one #5 Camalot). I was not able to clip the lower fixed pin  on pitch 4 because my Black Diamond OZ carabiner would not fit through the eyelet of the pin. Started late and climbed the last pitch in the dark sans head lamp. FUN! That made the route live up to it's name, literally. Easy to get down off of Higher in the dark. You have to go south toward Hanging Valley until it almost cliffs out and then trend south east. It is not harder than class 2 so if you run into cliffs you are going the wrong way. Eventually you wrap around (keep trending left) and then are north east facing. Now follow the obvious trail all the way down the gully and back to the road (same one you came up on). Micro nuts would have been good for some of the belays but we got by without. The belay at the top of pitch 3 was sketchy. The rest are all pretty solid.

I was already on edge due to the nature of the climbing on Stoner's, and her exclaimations had my heart in my throat...  I was actually relieved to find out the commotion was not because of catastrophic anchor failure or something like that, but rather because a mother bear and her cub had just strolled out of the woods in the direction of our packs (which were leaning against the wall at the base of the route).  Meanwhile a party of German climbers, eye level with us on Central Pillar, also began shouting as the bears paused to poke around at their packs.  I clipped into an anchor and watched helplessly as the bears left the Germans' packs (who quickly stopped yelling), and began sniffing ours.  A long minute passed.  Suddenly the bears turned around, leaving our packs alone, walked straight back to the Germans' packs, and began violently tearing them apart and eating their contents!  I'm not sure what they had in theirs but it must have been better than the sweaty socks and approach shoes in mine.

Mistake 2a was trying to clean from the static rap line, which veers off to the left so I couldn't clean it completely. Had to haul myself back up to do a two rope rappel. Mistake 2b was getting the rope stuck when we pulled it down.   P.S. The first pitch was really sandy and because of the snow base, you have to go from the face into the corner with some dicey maneuvers. The rest of the pitches were stellar though.

You could probably get a few small pieces in the unprotected face up top to get to the 2 bolt belay at the start of pitch 2, but the moves are easy if you can climb the 5.8 crack.  At the second belay use long slings or your rope to allow you to stand on the ledge and not hang.  If you want to do the 5.8 lieback first pitch on the left bring big gear.

So that beta is just from viewing it from below.  The whole thing looked wide all the way up, but you can lieback it and not OW.  It looks fun.   Pitch 2 is easier, 5.7 mostly, with some nice lieback sections and good gear.  We made a natural anchor in horizontals about 10' below the big roof.     Pitch 3 The roof accepts mid sized cams - maybe #1-#3 camalots as it varies in size, I used a #1.  Then move right while jamming up into the roof.  It really isn't so bad if you hand jam decently.  If you reach up and left after the roof there is a huge horn that takes the sting out of everything...though the lieback section to the top is continuous and I thought harder than the roof itself.  The exit move is a bit funky and be very careful to not knock rock down on climbers below you.  The slope up top is very loose...I would suggest walking high into the trees to belay.

Apparently there have been several injuries, including a friend of mine who broke her foot last year while simulclimbing third at the end of the rope (her husband was tied in 20' above her, unfortunately there was some slack between when she fell about 7 or 8 feet). The start is best protected by stepping up the trunk and placing gear as high as you can reach. Keep a tight belay for the follower(s). Some crack climb the start, others (like me) layback it, and one of my friends thought the knobs to the right of it were easier.   For the crux overhang on pitch 3, switching hands in the horizontal crack below the overhang is tricky. Once you've got your left hand set, reach your right hand up and right for a huge jug along the outside edge of the ROOF about a foot out from the vertical crack in the corner above the roof.

You will cause a traffic jam. You will be the reason people have to bail. Come prepared to build your own anchors and let the people coming down pass quickly!  - If you're a confident 5.8 climber, hop on the sharp end for the last pitch. It's a great climb to break into 5.9.  - If you have an 80m, bring it. That will allow you to link pitches 1+2, and 3+4, and you'll be able to rap from the tree directly to the dirt.

We found the topo in the Sloan et al guidebook for those pitches confusing. I'm not really sure there is a good way to describe where to go other than just follow the path of least resistance.   Regarding the approach: It was relatively easy to find the 5.6 slab that marks the base of the route. The gigantic right facing corner that is to the right of the route is also very clear from the base. Go up the gully to the right of the slab. Don't bother climbing the slab itself - it is unprotected and kinda sketchy in approach shoes. At this point, you might want to put climbing shoes on, but my advice is to stay unroped. Leading this pitch creates heinous rope drag. Climb up and left. Eventually you get to a grassy ramp that has been trampled. Continue up the ramp and up some blocky terrain until you see a steep gully with some trees on the left. The first ""real"" pitch starts at the top of the gully. We climbed the left-facing corner that is somewhat dirty and vegetated. It gets cleaner the higher you go.   Regarding the topout: After the last 5.9 pitch, continue up and climber's right. You will find a vegetated right-facing corner. Go up the corner and climber's left to gain Michael's Ledge. We placed some half-assed cairns since we weren't 100% certain we were going the right way.

In this case the descent is long, and creates major erosion walking down Michael's Ledge, so from a ecological standpoint a rappel route is preferred. I've descended both ways, and think rappelling is way better because it is much faster, and doesn't involve the scrambling to get up / on to Michael's Ledge.   As many have said, rapping with one 70m is no problem. There are bolts on the top of the first 5.9 pitch. From the base of this pitch walk downhill on a grassy hillside until you have to make a couple downclimbing moves (5.3) and you can look skier's left and see a rappel station on a ledge. This straightens the final descent bit, allowing you to rap straight down to a tree that is right above the base ledge.   Such a great route. Go For It!

If it had an easier approach and descent there would be very long lineups on this route. Good climb. For the approach walk up and right from the toe of Lower Brother. As you walk up look left for some cairns going up through the bushes. The photos found here are somewhat helpful. If you go up too far the ground will level off to the right. Turn around and go back looking for the cairns - they will be easier to find on the way back. The climbing up to the base of the route is 3rd and 4th class. Many people will want and or need a rope. It is about 80 meters from the cairns to the base of the route. Look for rappel stations as you are climbing up through the approach. There are three all very close to one another about halfway through the approach. One is good, the other two -not so good. Go relatively straight up from the rappel station (the one with the rings on a good live tree). This will lead you to the base of the climb. For pitch 1 we took the 5.9 finger/hand crack that breaks out left instead of the chimney offwidth straight up. It was ok but there were a lot of tree leaves and dirt in the cracks taking a lot of the fun away. I found it also had tricky movement with only pg gear near the crux. If you follow through with this variation taking the logical path it will lead you up to a couple of cool layback, left facing corners (fun!). Continue moving up and right through easier terrain. Problem is this brings you about 30 feet above the bolted belay/rappel station. It's not really a problem. You can easily build a gear anchor here and belay on a nice ledge. You can still get to the second pitch ok but be aware you will actually be bypassing the beginning of pitch 2. For pitch 2 we followed the splitter cracks. I did it in one long pitch. For the crack up to the tree I used just two #1 C4's. I did bump them a few times. The crack is ok but not perfect hands which makes it less enjoyable. Your 10 year nephew might be able to find perfect hand jams on this but most will not. After the tree (optional belay) the crack widens to fists and slightly bigger. There may have been some finger and hand jams way inside. I bumped a #3 a long way and exited via the beauty corner near the top just below the ledge. The next time I would head right into the left facing corner  near the bottom and follow it right to the top. It is gorgeous. For pitch 3 I went straight up into the big groove which is super cool and then got into the off width. I have climbed many Yosemite offwidths in the last month and this one is by far the most enjoyable with excellent protection. The #5 was really nice here. It fit well and was bumped all the way up. A pumpy layback will have you exit the crux of the offwidth and then up easier climbing to a small ledge below the chimney. I took a look at that chimney and almost bailed right to easier looking flakes but decided to suck it up and go for it. Glad I did this thing is the best part of the entire climb. So fun and good pro. We decided to rappel the route and with a 70 meter rope it works just fine but beware the first rappel is a bit of a rope stretcher to the ledge. Four raps for the climb and one or two for the approach. A short rappel here takes you to the tree (optional belay) on pitch 2 and then the bolted station for pitch 1 will take you to the ground. A word of caution re loose rock should be mentioned. On every ledge there are loose rocks that could easily be dislodged. Wear helmets and tred lightly. I had a double rack to #2, single #3,4 and 5, 10 draws. You could use the 4 and 5 on every pitch.  ",,Yosemite Valley,106451171,5.9,intermediate,"Sep 29, 2018"

Protects well and is great to break into 5.9 multipitch. I was pleasantly surprised to find it completely empty on a nice Saturday in May; the approach and involved descent must keep the crowds away.   I pitched this out as 5 shorter pitches. This resulted in little to no rope drag and let me have a tight belay above some ledges. The route description doing it this way would be as follows:   Pitch 0: junky approach pitch, rope up if/when you feel like it. Lots of 4th/low 5th terrain everywhere, hard to tell what the path of least resistance is.   Pitch 1: Climb the steep chimney, which looks intimidating but is actually fairly casual. Good jams and holds appear when you need them. Exit the chimney to a ledge on the right with a bolted anchor (and some tat as of May 2021). This pitch was very fun and creative.   Pitch 2: Climb the nice handcrack just to the right of the bolted anchor. You will get to a ledge on the left, but don't belay here; do some face climbing up and right to get to a higher ledge on the right that is right at the base of the splitter crack. Build a gear anchor here, it means you will have little rope drag and a tight belay for the tougher finger crack right off the ledge, which will be comforting if 5.9 is near your limit. This is a short pitch but it's fun and a good warmup for the tougher thin hands on the next pitch.   Pitch 3: Start up the finger crack which quickly turns into a splitter thin hands crack. Bring several number BD #1s. Belay at the obvious tree growing out of the crack. This is a great pitch!   Pitch 4: Continue up the crack (not the corner to the right of the crack), which gets a little wide right above the tree. You can reach deep inside the wide crack for wide hand jams; BD #3s are great here. I found this section very physical but at the same time very secure. Pull a fun small roof using great holds, and continue up the left facing corner to a nice ledge with trees. Another great pitch! Belay high up on the ledge at the base of whichever finish variation you choose; I built a gear belay right underneath the start of the lieback variation, which is marked by a short left facing corner below a small roof. You could easily combine this with the previous pitch; it wouldn't result in extra rope drag, and it would protect well as the previous pitch wants BD #1s whereas this pitch wants #3s and maybe a #4; it would also skip the hanging belay at the tree.   Pitch 5: I did the lieback variation, which is a fantastic pitch. Follow the short left facing corner, pull around the small roof, and continue up and occasionally to the right on liebacks and finger cracks in corners.   We decided to rope up for one short section of the approach, but didn't feel the need to rope up for the scramble to Michael's Ledge. Both have some easy 5th class sections.   Pro: I brought triples of hand size cams (BD 0.75-3) which was nice to have to really sew up the 5.9 handcrack sections; doubles in smaller sizes. You could get away with doubles with some bumping/backcleaning. I brought a #4 which was nice in a few spots but not really necessary. No #5 as I did not do the OW variation for the last pitch.

The slabs approach isn't dangerous unless you make it that way. Providing the ropes are all there, stick to the left side when up in the ""slabs"" area. The trail's easier and you don't have to cross the steep talus above potentially knocking bowling balls down the slabs. That's the dangerous part, stick close by your partners and if someones ahead of you, put some distance between you and them or catch up really quick and walk with them throuhg the loose crap. Most of the route is a stroll through the woods. Only a short section has steep, wet slabs where veering off course would be dangerous. Luckly the trail's easy to follow.

It's a little bulky to pack up the slabs, but it's the right thing to do.   3. Climb the thing in a day, sleeping at the base the nights before and after.   4. Rack for a moderately paced in-a-day ascent (we aided the hard parts): single set of smallest cams, double blue tcu to #3 camalot.  Didn't need nuts, but obviously they can be placed.   5. Crux of the route for me seems like the bolt ladder pitch above thank god ledge (the second to last pitch of the route).  Bolt placement requires either a hardish (>5.9) couple of slab moves to reach a higher pendulum point or a tricky (>C1) few traversing aid moves.  This is the only section of the route where I haven't yet (after doing the route twice and climbing both options described above) found a 5.9 C1 method.   Enjoy!   Edit after another ascent in 2012: #1 is questionable advice. No bugs in late summer/early fall and the weight of a tent/bivy might not be worth it anyway. #5 is also questionable. This time around, aiding the upper bolt ladder pitch seemed really chill and straightforward (C1).   ","Moab, Utah",Yosemite Valley,105912416,5.9,intermediate,"Jun 25, 2009"

There are 4 crux pitches, all checking in right around 11d/12a, and all with different styles. If you want to onsight, don't read any further.    -The first free variation starts at the 2-bolt belay right before the 5.11/A1->bolt ladder pitch on the regular route (P4). From the belay, traverse left, past an old bolt (11a), then up a dihedral. There's a wide spot here, a #4 camalot is very useful(11b). Belay just below the obvious Higbee-Hedral boulder problem. There's a fixed pin at the top of the 12' steep corner, with plenty of tat hanging down so that you can clip it for a top rope. A few moves of strenuous stemming lead to a sloping mantel (11d/12a). At this point, you can drop a loop of slack back down to your belayer and haul up the rack for the rest of the pitch, allowing you to have nothing on your harness for the crux. The remainder of the pitch is fun 5.11, mostly liebacking and stemming, trending right and rejoining the regular route midway through its 5th pitch.   -There's a long free variation around the Robbins traverse and bolt ladder. Continue up the prominent corner/gully system past the Robbins for about another pitch length. Make an exposed 5.10 traverse past some large loose flakes, and then downclimb a strenuous 5.9 corner (I thought the downclimb was harder than the traversing part, so maybe it's closer to 5.10). The downclimb drops you back onto the regular route, on the large ledge below the chimney pitches. There is some fixed gear with a biner at the top of the downclimb, the second should leave this clipped for top rope pro. With a 60m rope, you'll need to belay at the base of the downclimb (instead of the bolts 20' further along the ledge) in order to have enough rope for the second to make it down. With a 70m, you can belay at the bolts.   -There's a few variations to the first chimney pitch, which supposedly had some tight 5.9 squeeze on it. The crack to the left of the chimney can be climbed at 5.11, and apparently the short traverse back to the main route can be done free at a similar grade. I have not done any of these options.   The best way on this pitch, in my opinion, is to start up the chimney (easy and spacious at this point), and then traverse deep into the chimney towards a body-sized window a little ways in. Step through the window and pull up into a splitter finger crack (5.10)! Climb this until it veers off right, then make a short, face-y traverse (also 5.10) back left to the regular route. This variation is excellent, well-protected, and airy.   -The remaining chimney pitches and some easy traversing pitches (easy to simul) lead to Big Sandy ledge and the start of the ZigZags. The Zags are the meat of the tough climbing.   The first pitch features clean finger crack climbing for a while (11a) to a good stance. From here, battle up a short, thin, pinscarred layback to a distinct crux move (12a). A plethora of fixed nuts protect this section. Above here, one more hard move is encountered: a reachy 5.11 face move (the aid route tension traverses here).   -The second Zag is probably harder than 5.10 (as given by some topos). I'd say 11b. The crux of this pitch is pulling over a small roof. This can be combined with the previous pitch, as long as your careful with drag.   -The third ZigZag gives you two options: straight up the aid line (12+?), or out right on another thin crack (12a). The easier way goes right just off the belay, underclinging with good, but strenuous to place small gear (an extra blue or green alien is nice here). The difficulty eases as you turn from underclinging to laybacking, but there's a crux coming higher (when you're nice and pumped). As the angle of the corner eases, the crack pinches down and you have to make some thin moves. Above here, rejoin the regular route for some 5.10 crack climbing to the belay before Thankgod ledge.   -The final bit of hard climbing comes on the slab/bolt ladder pitch after TG ledge. Climb the steep slab with small, slope-y holds past the closely spaced bolts (11d). After clipping the bolt with all the tat (the one the aid route penji's off of), you have to make a short run to the next bolt (10' or so, a bit exciting). From that bolt, continue up to a horizontal crack system, then traverse easily left on it to the belay.   One more wandery 5.8 pitch and you've sent!

May 2nd, 2015.  The spring is running strong and is the best and coldest water you will ever taste.  I promise.   The chimney pitches, specifically pitches 13 and 14, are by far some of the best chimney climbing I have ever experienced and are easily linked with a 60 (we had a 70).  Stellar movements mixed with great airy exposure and an absolutely in your face view of the high country makes for some very memorable climbing.  The 5.9 squeeze variation really does not look fun, and I really don't understand why anyone in there right mind would want to try it (I guess after doing the route enough times, you look for ways to spice it up).  For an idea of how squeezey it is, there is a 1L Nalgene stuck deep in the crack.  Small.   We started the route at 5:26 am and were able to make Big Sandy by 6 pm.  Definitely not going for any speed record here, but I felt like it was a reasonable time, albeit we could have moved a little quicker through some of the lower pitches.     Things really begin to slow down at the ZigZags, which, even after linking and short-fixing, still took us three hours to overcome.   Pitch 21 is where I really began to run into trouble.  The hooking is not straight-forward, and after a slip of my foot while reaching for a bolt, I had a cam hook snap in half.  This pitch really requires you to keep your head together, which gets difficult after 21 pitches and many hours of climbing, and the vizor is less than 50 feet over your head.  I ended up whipping three times due to hooks blowing.  I was very stoked to reach the three-pin belay.    The final pitch can be completely freed.  Although the friction climbing is spooky, it goes a lot easier than it appears.  Do not aid.  Do not.   Rope drag crippled my partner on this pitch, and even prevented him from making the final (amazing) 5.7 mantel move for the top out.  He had to give his all into pulling enough rope to pulling over the lip.  He ended up fixing the rope because it would have taken too much to pull up the rope to put me on belay.  Very frustrating.     Nonetheless, we topped out at 2:20 in the morning after 21 hours, and only a 30 minute break.  The full moon accompanied us and gave us some incredibly cold blue views of this beautiful valley.     Bring plenty of snacks and even more stoke.  You're climbing the freaking face of Half Dome.

I remember bits and pieces of the adventure: the really cool and unexpected spring at the base, leading the pitch to Big Sandy in the dark, the sound of my bivvy parka bouncing away as my friend unpacked the haulbag in the dark (we spent a very uncomfortable night huddled together), dropping trow with my back against the wall and my feet on Big Sandy letting loose of a big smelly ca-ca down the chimney of the direct route (sorry-that’s what was done back then), I distinctly remember a section at the end of the Thank God traverse that caught me by surprise at how hard it was, the surprise on the faces of the tourists at the top when we topped out on the morning of the second day. On our hike down we were approached by a portly guy at the top of the falls in Bermuda shorts and black street shoes and calf high black socks held up by some kind of garter belt. He was straight out of a Hunter Thompson book illustration and wanted to know where the hot dog stand was that someone had told him about. My buddy and I looked at each other and with completely straight faces pointed up the trail and said it was a mile or so further. Good times. I miss you Dave.

All pitches went fairly quick except P12 (took a long time in spite of getting the toss on the first try; fig-8 on a bight with a biner worked fine). The first tension traverse was not too bad but the mantle move was tough. **The bolt at the rope toss is missing** (can see the sleeve where it used to be). Instead there's a fixed #1 brassy at that location. Works for now and was in good shape. Was a decent rope and longer 5mm cord hanging below the anchor of P12. Linked P13-15 with our 70m.

For those familiar with the route, ignore the rest of the post… probably more details than you’d ever want:  - the approach = the climbers trail is marked with a carabiner post, amazing!  Steph Abegg's photo (on her website,  sites.google.com/stephabegg…, and in the newest edition of Erik Sloan's book are so amazing, you can literally follow the map as you walk.  One useful thing - remembering where to exit/enter the gulleys during the descent can be elusive (especially when you're tired), so taking a picture of those turnoffs on the way up was really helpful to have on the way down.    - the springs = there's currently three springs right at the base of P1, so awesome to have access to unlimited water!   - we fixed the first two pitches = a 70m rope definitely reaches the ground unweighted, no reason to bring up any additional cord  - P4 = that crack after the bolt ladder is spectacular, a true indulgence!  - P7 = as Mark Kroese said, there are two trees, go right just below the first tree (it's 1-2 moves of 5.8, a mantle, and then immediately step out right and climb up and right through the flakes to a horizontal row of manzanita to set the belay)  - P8 = go horizontally right (not up, and actually there are a few steps down) around the corner, into the gulley, do a few moves of 5.7-5.8, and then set the belay when the large ledge taking you to P9 anchor pillar connects to the gulley.    - P9 = the destination is the top of a pillar (as someone said) which is marked with the white stripe of P10s bolt ladder.  Just walk along the big prominent ledge to the right side of the pillar, and you'll see large horizontal flat ledges that take you right up to the anchor.  The 5.9+ section for the left approach is totally unnecessary, the right side of the pillar is an easy 4th scramble to the anchor.    - P12 = we broke this into two pitches because... uhhhh, a friggin wall rat chewed 30ft of our rope to bits while we had it fixed the night before so we had to chop it (if doing this as one pitch, I think you may need a 70m to have enough rope for penji’s).  The belay is basically a splitter crack sized 0.75s, but you can sneak a #0.5 and #1 in there too for an anchor.  Also - no more rope toss!  Three new bolts take you right to the base of the chimney  - P13-P14 = the chimneys are casual, but i will say that taking the 5.7 airy way does not leave you with much pro for about 20'.  Even though this airy section is wide, i'm 5'10"" and did not feel overextended chimneying, did not need to stem.  I did find a single brass nut was nice to keep the runout from being too long, but regardless, it's standard chimney technique... and just like they say in the valley, it's one of those sections where ""your protection is your technique.""  - P17 = alright... I went too high.  here's my learning... a fun perfectly sized hand crack widens to a #4 size crack reminiscent of Moby Dick, and half way up i was thinking, this is fine, but not really fun... if the topo calls this pitch ""fun"" then maybe i'm off-route... so i down led, and realized this = after 10' up the fun hand crack, and before the crack widens to a #4 OW, a few knobs appear on the face to the right of the crack that allow you to exit right to a big ledge.  Take this exit, and bam!  Big Sandy!   - P18 = if you're going to sleep on Big Sandy, it's really nice to fix the first pitch of the zig zags.  Fortunately we had time left in the afternoon to do this, and glad we did because another party arrived at Big Sandy late at night (like 3am late, wow, hardcore!) and it was really nice to be able to get a head start when we all woke up in the morning.   - Thank God Ledge = the ledge is as iconic as you imagined, does not disappoint!  Takes #1, #2, and a #3, clip a bolt, jam the corner chockstone, and use an amazingly convenient right foot next to the bolt to get into the OW.  You could probably aid through it with a #5, but without the 5, you’re gonna have to do it yourself.  Go right side in, and also amazingly convenient is a delicious crisp 2-pad crimp for your right hand that let’s you get purchased in the squeeze, and from there it’s 2 moves of OW and you’re done.    - P22 = 2-3 5.6 free moves to get the bolt ladder, penji and with the help of a black totem and a hook, you can get the second left bolt ladder.  From here, there is no other penji, after the top bolt, do 1-2 hook moves to a fixed nut and this will allow you to step left to the belay ledge.   - P23 = 5.7 slab that has a great right crimp to allow you to place that first piece of gear, and then you traverse left under the shelf until it ends in nice 5.5 big ledges to the top.

Below is some detailed beta for the Approach, Descent, General Info, Route Beta, Ropes and linking pitches. We were lucky to have a beautiful sunny day with temps in the 70’s and one friendly party of two behind us. It was a fun, successful climb without any major issues.   Approach  We followed the approach directions and topos from the Sloan book “Rock Climbing Yosemite Valley”. From the Mirror Lake trail there is an obvious wooden post with a carabiner image where you need to turn off. The drainage was not well cairned as indicated in the book and we added more cairns on our descent where they were sparse. We got shut down by a chance of rain and ended up approaching and descending the death slabs twice. The first time we ascending the 3 hand lines and slabs on the left of the gully with heavy packs, which was somewhat treacherous. The second time we jugged the long decent rappel line on the right, which became our preferred method. It doesn’t mention it in the book, but at the top of the gully there is a fair amount of traveling (on trails) through thick brush to the base of the rock. Approach took about 4 hours.   General Beta  The spring is literally ten feet left of the start of the route and was running. We had good cell signal with Verizon at the base and for the whole route. The trees dripped sap and the mosquitoes came out right at sunset. Sphinx moths dive bombed our headlamp/face in the morning (can be avoided using a red light).   Route beta  The route had a very alpine feel, where the first half was dirty with grit and sand, but the rock quality improved for the second half. To link pitches better (especially ones with bolt ladders) and to avoid drag on traverses, we would have liked to have more than the 14 slings and long alpine draws we brought. Linking P7 and P8 created horrible rope drag.The new bolts to bypass the rope toss on P14 are very loose, so bring a wrench if you can. Some tat and spare biners would also be handy as some of the lower-out cords looked a bit rotten.    The wind really picked up as we came around the horn/corner on P17  but it kept things cool for the “sunny” (partly cloudy) Zig Zag pitches. These pitches entered the sun around 2pm. We were comfortable all day just wearing pants, t-shirts, a light polypro long sleeve, and near the end of the day a light rain jacket. We each had 3L of water and about 600 calories of food.   Ropes  The first day we climbed the first two pitches and found our “70” to be about 15 feet short. However, another party fixed the first two pitches with their brand new 70 meter rope and just made it to the ground. We ended up using an 80 meter rope, which easily worked to fix P1 & P2. The 80 was helpful to link P3 & P4 and then P5 & P6, but a 70 might work too. Also, we easily linked the chimney section, P15 & P16, with 15 feet to spare.   P22 & P23   We basically followed the same beta that John Gassel posted above. We aided P23 for the traverse section.   Descent  We started at 3:30am and without really stopping, finished at 8:30pm, 17 hrs of climbing. The descent down the cables, stairs, and climber trail took about 2 hours. To get to the cables from the top walk northeast and continue in that direction for most of the rock decent. We actually used the satellite mode in the iPhone maps app to get an idea of where to go. The cables are crazy steep and very slippery and walking down backward was easier to manage. Using gloves would be helpful too. After the cables you end up in a saddle and have to hike up and over another dome until you find the rock stairs. At the bottom of the stairs was a bear box and the regular descent trail goes right. There was supposed to be a climber trail going left, but we couldn’t find any cairns or trail so we just kept working left and stayed about the same elevation. Eventually we were forced down into a gully and found a cairned trail to follow back to camp. There was no major scrambling or anything very difficult on this part of the decent, just hiking down and across hillsides.

People often point out that there are only seven pitches rated 5.12a or harder on the Nose (only 7 out of 30!), but that doesn't mean that the rest is easy. Heck the first four pitches all have short, slippery sections of hard 5.11 that regularly spit off 5.13 climbers. And sure it gets more splitter after the first four pitches, but the exposure (and the wind!) cranks up and most folks find even the Boot Flake, a mere 5.10c, too much to free climb. To free climb the Nose is badass!...and there is a reason why only a handful of people have done it. Stats: .0000001% of all Nose climbers    2. French Free - 5.10 C1+. If you can free climb solid 5.10 multi-pitch in the Valley, like you can knock off East Butress of El Cap (awesome for getting the descent dialed, too ;), Serenity to Sons of Yesterday, Northeast Buttress of Higher Cathedral, Steck/Salathe, and maybe Freeblast, with little challenge, then climbing the Nose in three and a half days (half day fix to Sickle, first day to El Cap Tower, second day to Camp 5, third day to the top) in a french free style (free climbing half or more of most pitches and just pulling on pieces through the more difficult sections) should be easy enough. Stats: 10 - 15% of Nose climbers   3. Traditional Bigwall Style - 5.8 C2. For most of us, despite talking a good game, the aiders come out about 15 - 20 feet up the first pitch. The Nose is incredible, but it is not easy. I have climbed the Nose over 20 times and there are 5.9 pitches that I have not freed completely. Everything is harder with two ropes and lots of gear on you! That said, the Nose is awesome at this grade, and it should be encouraging to all climbers that with good physical fitness, you only have to climb 5.8 to climb the Nose! Despite how much practice aiding you did at your home crag, and how many triathlons you just competed, climbing a warm up route - with the partner(s) you intend to climb the Nose with - like South Face of Washington Column, The Reg on Half Dome, SW Face of Liberty Cap, or West Face of the Leaning Tower shortly before your Nose climb will greatly tune you into the mountains and how you can thrive on them. The Nose in this style will take you four and half days to climb - a half (to three quarter) day fixing to Sickle, day one to Dolt Tower or nearby, day two to Camp 4, day three to Camp 6, Day four to the summit(maybe with time to walk down, but why rush - enjoy a night on top!)  A fair number of folks tell me they wish they had done the East Buttress(5.10c) of El Cap before climbing the Nose, so they would have had the descent dialed, and could relax more on top. Stats: 60 - 70% of Nose climbers   4. NIAD (or NIADL - NIAD in daylight) - 5.10 C1+. Climbing 28 pitches in a day, with a casual 10 - 15 minute approach and a mellow 1 hr descent, is ridiculously good. But don't kid yourself that it is better than bivying on the route - it's awesome, but shorter lived ;). Onsighting the Niad is pretty rare. Most folks practice for the Niad by climbing the first third of the route, to Dolt Tower or Eagle Ledge, which allows you to understand how to get through the traversing lower bit efficiently. Then it's good to climb South Face of Column, SW FAce of LIberty Cap, or Reg on Half Dome, in a day to get ur systems more dialed.

It gets very windy on the Nose, and folks spend so much time on the lower part of the route dealing with second ropes that are blowing around, that these new rap stations should be super useful. There have also been numerous rescues due to stuck ropes. These new rap stations will alleviate some of the congestion from people slowing down to deal with a second rope, whether they are teams that are fixing to Sickle(have the second jug with the extra ropes in a pack!) or those that are doing a Dolt Run to practice, and will allow people to climb safer and more efficiently through the lower part of the route.   If Fixing Ropes from Sickle: You no longer have to tie your ropes together and pass knots - you rap down 190' to the first anchor, another 190' to the second anchor, and then 197' to the ground. There are anchors in between these stations for one-rope rapping.    Pros of Cons of Fixing Ropes to Sickle as opposed to hauling right from the base of Pine Line ledge:     Pros:     1. You don't have to bring all of your stuff when you start, and can remember things you might need during your initial climbing (very, very huge - if you are not super experienced with bigwall climbing this alone is probably reason enough to fix to Sickle).    2. You get to try out the climbing and exposure of El Cap without the commitment. Fix down from Sickle and take a hot shower and eat a pizza - you'll be twice as stoked!    3. Allows you a day to see which other parties are starting the route, and how their progress is going, without being stuck behind them.      Cons:   1. Fixing to Sickle means having to bring a third rope, to rap down, so if your partner is not sturdy enough to jug with a pack with two ropes in it (you lead with one rope, other two ropes go in the pack with water, wind jackets, and snacks), then you are just making more work, more hauling, just to get the ropes fixed so you can haul some more (I'm saying that you will have to haul a small bag with two ropes to Sickle Ledge, just to rap down and haul your big bag from the ground to Sickle Ledge). This is a pretty big con, and I would recommend any teams that weigh less than 115 lbs to consider if it would just be easier for them to haul from the ground, and continue climbing. (of course, you can pretty easily meet up with another party that is also fixing to Sickle, and agree to share their third rope (You would fix your two ropes down from Sickle, but just use their third rope to reach the ground), and then you only have to climb with two ropes like normal and can have all of the benefits of fixing to Sickle above).    2. You have to deal with the jockeying for position that is the reality that there are normally many parties trying to climb the Nose. When you haul right from the ground, you are on the wall, and you will quickly find a pace and rhythm of ascent that keeps you a pitch or two above or below other parties. It is common for people to share fixed lines from Sickle - so seeing one set of lines is no guarantee that you might jug up to Sickle after fixing and only find one party there. The last years have seen big traffic jams on the lower part of the route, around Sickle.    In the future, having fixed ropes from Sickle, in season, that climbers maintain but can use anytime, might go along way toward mitigating the congestion around this part of the route.   Woot!

Reading the description at the top of this page I understand now why folks might still be using the outdated Supertopo topo, and not our more current one.   1. The 11a variation to the left of the first pitch (believed to be the original first pitch of the Nose, as climbed by Harding), is now the first pitch of a new, bottom-to-top free route (5.13d, 38 pitches), and is well bolted (as is a second pitch(5.9, five bolts) to the popular Pine Line which is right below this first pitch. There is a new anchor 10'/3m down and left of the 1st pitch anchor on the Nose for this variation pitch. This could provide a convenient way for Niad or other parties to pass people on the first pitch.     2. New anchor 15' above Sickle Ledge. The pitch off Sickle Ledge, 210'/62m, has always been tricky for bigwall parties (meaning those hauling bags) because folks tend to bring a 60m haul line, which comes up short right as the leader is trying to do the last moves (steep 5.9+), to the belay. This new anchor allows you to haul your haulbag to a slightly higher anchor (best if you just do it when you are hauling to Sickle - so don't haul to Sickle and then do another 15'/5m haul, just climb up to the higher anchor (3rd class) and haul to there instead). Now the pitch off of Sickle is a manageable 190', and folks are having less epics there.   3. Bolted anchor at the base, and end, of the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. Two pitches before Camp 4, in the notoriously loose 'Grey Bands,' is the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. The belay used to be one bolt and small cams but is now two bolts. Climbers scoped and developed this variation to the original Nose route because of the ubiquitous loose rock in the entire, four pitch Grey Bands section. This is a much better way to climb toward Camp 4, and these newly bolted anchors allow more options for parties, who tend to get congested in this area. Before, folks who climbed this variation had to climb the wrong way up and right, 15'/3m, to a bolted anchor at the end of the pitch. Now there is a two bolt anchor right at the end of the Traverse, which also makes the super traversing next pitch to Camp 4 a little more straightforward.    4. Old Belay re-established belay Great Roof. For a while in the 90s and 2000s the belay for the GR was a bolt and two fixed pins at a horn right below the corner that leads to the roof. The bolt is still there, and can be used by Niad parties looking to pass, but the old belay 10'/3m below this spot, which is a nice stance ledge and is the original belay, has been re-established with three good bolts.    5. Belay below the final bolt ladder reduced in size, new bolts added for belaying higher, towards the end of the bolt ladder. While the Free Nose climbers still build a belay at the top of the final 10c crack off the Wild Stance (because the free route through the bolt ladder is wandering and stout), there is no longer a spread out belay there but instead there is one 50' higher up the bolt ladder. This helps the top-out pitches flow much smoother as now you do a longer, 135'/42m pitch off the Wild Stance, and then a short pitch to the anchor below the summit, instead of a short pitch off the Wild Stance (awesome hang), and then a long pitch over the bolts and around the slab (which is always windy and difficult to communicate through).

Haul the pig from here and your follower just needs to lower out (or swing) from the top of the Boot Flake.  Additionally you can skip another one and a half pitches of hauling by leaving the pig at the intermediate belay on pitch 19 (make sure the pig is hanging from the anchor with a fifi held upright with a prusik) and climbing up to the pitch 20 anchor.  Your follower will then clean pitch 20 and you continue up pitch 21 and haul the pig from the top of pitch 21, avoiding all the trouble of hauling the rest of pitch 19 & 20.  Hopefully this helps.

First I believe that dialing in your transitions and rope management may be the single biggest thing that could help save you time. We passed/watched quite a few parties that were building weird anchors and always doing things differently etc. the nose has bolted anchors from top to bottom and all you need to do is pre tie two quad style anchors and then when you get to the anchor you just clip it in and do what you need to do.  Recognize how to keep your haul line and lead line from tangling, and learn how to do the revolving door technique with a carabiner to move ropes in and out of each other. Practice hauling on other routes beforehand. Saw a lot of weird hauling up there that didn’t look fun. Do some shorter walls that are technically harder than the Nose. I found The Prow to be really good because it’s sustained aiding at a level that is more difficult than anything on the nose. Also hauling the last couple pitches is more difficult than any hauling on the nose.  Dial in your lower outs and techniques for following traversing terrain. The nose has gobs of traverses on it and you can waste a lot of time in that terrain if you don’t know what you’re doing.  I find when following easier low angle traverses over towers and stuff it’s sometimes easiest to just throw the gri gri on and self belay while French freeing.  Also free climb as much as possible. We didn’t free that much, but a mix of French free/free/aid goes a long way to efficiency. If you think you’ll be aiding the 5.8 glory hand crack on the stovelegs, you may want to reconsider your route choice.   I’m no expert, but these are my reflections on the trip and I feel may be more helpful than “you need a set of offsets for the nose” because though that may be true, if you’ve never placed an offset before going up on the nose, just having it isn’t go to do much for you.

Tip: avoid the east side of Texas flake and clipping the bolt, that side is much harder. Stick to the west side of the flake, and then flip the rope to the outside of the flake for the follower. Plenty of fixed gear in all the right places. Bolts on changing corners have nice new rope loops hanging from them so it is a quick C1 aid up those leaving only one move of C2 (shallow 2 lobe black totem).   Rack:   3 sets of totems, 2x #3, 1x #3.5, 1x #4  1 large cam hook used after bolt ladder on boot flake pitch  1 pointy hook used for start of P4  No nuts, no cams smaller than black totem, no micro nuts, no offset cams or offset nuts, no ball nuts,  Camp VI is not that ideal for sleeping, would suggest camp V instead. Or there is a decent flat spot 30ft below camp VI good for 1.  Have fun!!!  ","San Luis Obispo, CA",Yosemite Valley,105924807,5.9,intermediate,"Sep 17, 2021"

Most of the free is hard 5.10 with a few exceptions, and you need to be a 5.10 leader to be able to deal with anything that may come up. The Nose has been climbed so quickly and by so many people that it tends to get minimized, but it is a long serious route, and giving it a light rating may seem cool to some people, but it is a disservice as far as general info. If you aid every possible pitch then the hardest mandatory free climbing would be 5.9, but if you aid every possible pitch it will take you a week to top out. Be prepared for many crack pitches in the 5.10C-D range. Even if you do aid every pitch, the swing into the stoveleg crack is absolutely a 5.10 manuver. It is also harder than A2.  The swing is huge and you have to hurdle a flake in mid swing. When you dive into the hand jams of stoveleg and get your feet in the crack you are on a massive runout. Any pendulum is A2 just because its a pendulum. The stoveleg pendulum is giant and has obstacles. A2+ minimum. When i led the great roof there was a pin missing under the roof right in the middle. I had to wangle a barely body weight wired stopper to get to the next pin. You should prepare for 5.10 and A3.  ","Poway, CA",Yosemite Valley,105924807,5.9,intermediate,"Feb 20, 2022"

On day 1 we dropped our pig at the base of the fixed lines directly below Heart Ledges. There are lines in place but they are not super awe-inspiring. We climbed Freeblast and rapped to the ground and bivied at our pig. Day 2 involved jugging and hauling to Heart ledges, and climbing to the top of El Cap spire. It was sprinkling as we ended and decided to sleep at the Alcove, which aside from the view on the spire, looked WAY more comfy that the top of the spire. Day 3 involved climbing to Long Ledges. We bivied there and this turned out to a comfortable bivy for three. My favorite bivy to date. Day 4 topped out and hiked off.   Tips:  1. Aside from the Freeblast, not many anchors are solid bolts. Many are a single good bolt and gear, or old pins and gear.    2. Link a lot of pitches. Ending above the sewer are OLD 1/4 inch bolts and a totally hanging belay. If you keep going 40 more feet it is a awesome sloping ledge.    3. The pitch above the sloping ledge is sort of confusing. You take the left most crack, and pendulum at the 1st pendulum spot. The crack you are aiming for is kinda hidden but once you swing, you will find it. There is a lot of left gear higher to the right, don't go for it, it is all off route.    4. The roof pitch is all fixed, minus once cam placement which could probably be skipped.    5. The pitch off the right, east, side of Long Ledge is NOT 5.8. It starts as easy c1, but the crack ends, the pin marked on topos is missing and mandatory 5.10 climbing is present. The climbing is probably 8+ feet above you last solid cams. Drop the rack (bring a single set for the anchor and getting to it), sac it up and fire! I actually led to the free climbing, I pussed out and Bill G. made a 3 points off dyno to a sloping side pull.   6. The ear is a hard grovel put protected. Don't bring your helmet. Also, careful with you cam placements. My last one pinched the rope and I could not pull the rope, I actually backcleaned it to get to the anchor.     7. Rap, don't hike. Its a long way.

Didn't use any cam hooks or hooks.  Mostly aid climbed with moderate backcleaning.     Bivies: Hollow Flake Ledge is a nice bivy with a portaledge.  Alcove is plush (one 2 bolt anchor and one portaledge bolt, room for 3-4 pretty comfortably on the ground).  Ended up using the sloping ledge below the Teflon Corner - decent spot if you have a ledge.  The Block is as advertised - large and sloping.   Hollow Flake is pretty tame as long as you focus on the climbing and not the runout.  On SuperTopo's pitch 16, there's an intermediate anchor out left at a smaller than 4x3 ledge - continue to the 4x3 ledge.  The Ear is fantastic - walk some big gear above your head so you're on TR for the whole pitch, and backclean it so your partner doesn't curse you while jugging this thing.  Clip the bolt out right at the end for smooth rope organization.  Climbing the Sewer makes it feel like you're on an adventure - relish the wetness and then enjoy the sweet handcrack corner to the block!  The pitch up to Sous le Toit is a bit inobvious - after a mantle move, clip a pin which hopefully has a long piece of tat on it, then look left about 15 feet for the pendulum point.  Do not get sucked up right along the beautiful flake to multiple bail slings.  Up higher, there are 3 spots on the route where it felt like C2: just before the pitch 27 (SuperTopo) anchor (which you should skip and continue to just below the roof); from the protection bolt to the belay on pitch 29 (just above the roof); and a short bit just below long ledge.  The pitch 34 ""5.9 squeeze and C1"" involved a short squeeze to good gear at the top of the chimney, then lowering out to good face holds outside the slot.  Then enjoy the beautiful low angle hand crack to the top of the route!  I linked pitches 34 and 35.  There's a horizontal crack at the top that takes good .4, .5, and .75 camalots.  Also there's a nice, flat, unprotected bivy near a tree directly above this final anchor.  Enjoy!  ","Moab, Utah",Yosemite Valley,106154042,5.9,intermediate,"Jun 2, 2009"

We didn't find this wide section to be too terrifying without the #5, so we were glad we did not lug it up the route. We had a double rack from black alien to #3, one #4, and a set of stoppers. We found this rack was plenty sufficient.  • We led in blocks. I led Pitches 1-5 and 9-10 and Ryan led Pitches 6-8 and 11.  • We linked Pitches 1 & 2 by soloing up the first 70 feet. We linked Pitches 4-5 by being wise with long slings to reduce rope drag. We linked Pitches 6-8 into two pitches; this allowed us to have a more comfortable belay spot than the small stance at the top of the standard Pitch 6. We had a single 60m rope.  • From reading the comments, there is a wide range for how long it takes to do this route. Some parties get benighted. Some take 4 hours from base to top. We were somewhere in-between: we left the car at 6:45am and got back at about 6:45pm, for a 12 hour no-headlights car-to-car day; we never rushed and we took a lunch break en route to allow a speedy Swiss team to pass us.   • I'd say the route earns the ""+"" on the 5.9+.

But I’d never climbed any squeeze chimneys, and the short but evil chimney in the middle on the 7th gave me enough hell that I will not be coming back to this route until my squeeze technique and/or strength improves! One and done for now.   	We were afraid we were off route in the beginning bc on the first pitch, the Sloan topo showed stopping at bolt anchor 160 ft up. There were bolts like 80ish ft up by a tree, but we belayed at rap rings higher up on a ledge with two wide cracks like 5 ft apart. Don’t pay too much attention to the pitch lengths - we found them all to be wrong.   	From the sound of other comments, we are glad we stayed left for the 10th/11th pitches and didn’t go in the right 9+ off width thats on the Supertopo. At the top of the second to last pitch, we belayed on a slanted ledge above where it says on on the Sloan too “5.7 hands blocks” and for the final pitch then proceeded up a flared hands/fist crack to a huge ledge. I think the final chimney was around a corner to my right, but not feeling another chimney, I went straight up the blocky face in front of me. There was lichen everywhere (not a popular variation I guess!), the blocks/flakes sounded a bit hollow, but good pro and went at 5.9ish.

Use this information in conjunction with the MP description, guidebooks, etc.  The following is current as of Sept 29, 2022.   Yes, the rating is a sandbag, but if you show up with the mindset that you could be asked to climb ~10b at any given time, you’ll probably do fine.  Pitch 3, 7, 8, and 12 (or 11 if you don’t break it up) felt like the cruxes.   RECOMMENDED RACK   Offset nuts, single BD 0.2, single black Totem if you’ve got it, double 0.3 - 3, single 4, optional 5.  We had a couple finger sized offset cams as well (0.2/0.3 and 0.3/0.4), and made good use of them.  We placed the 5 several times, and were happy to have carried it.  A few lightweight short draws, and lots of extendable alpine draws.  We used a single 60m rope.    APPROACH   Guidebook maps do a decent job of laying out the basics.  Park in the pullout on the south side of the loop road (Southside Drive), or, if you’re coming from the east, park on the small connector road near El Cap Meadow (El Capitan Drive) to avoid driving all the way around the loop, and walk 2 minutes to the pullout.   Head up the main trail from the center of the pullout, arriving at the Valley Loop Trail in about 1 minute.  Turn left, walk for another minute, and take your first right on an unsigned, but good, trail.  (If you parked on El Capitan Drive, there is a marginally faster way to get to this point - consult guidebook maps if you're interested.)   Eventually, ahead and left, you will see a large boulder with TONS of chalk on the holds.  The trail continues straight towards it, but look for a hard right turn a little bit before you get to the boulder (but within sight of it).  It’s a good trail, but has several downed trees across it currently, making it possible to miss.  Climb over the trees, there’s only a few of them.  Follow this good trail as it winds up the hill for quite a while, until you find yourself on the left side of a large talus slope.   Follow a heavily cairned route across to the right side of the talus slope, and uphill along the talus (more cairns) from there.  Eventually, the cairns lead you to a trail in the forest, on the right side of the talus, close to the cliffs.  This part is minimally cairned, but the trail isn’t too hard to follow.  This trail ultimately brings you back to the talus, where you ascend (lightly cairned) for a while longer.  Again, the cairns will lead you to a second trail in the forest, on the right side.  Somewhere visible near the edge of the talus may be the ideal place to rack up and leave your packs (it’d be hard to blow past this spot on the descent).   Wherever you leave your packs, pick some good landmarks (the Cathedral Spires work well, and can be seen somewhat in the dark if it’s clear out).  Consider the fact that you might be coming back in the dark - a GPS waypoint, or noting the elevation, could be good ideas.  Bring your headlamp on the route.   At this point, you’ll want to start eyeballing your approach to the base of Higher Cathedral Rock.  Once back in the forest, you'll see a small patch of open talus surrounded by trees.  From the right side of this talus patch, pick up (sometimes rougher) trails that lead a short distance to the base of the cliff.   Once you arrive at the cliff, you’ll need to head right a ways to find the base of the route.  Steph Abegg has a photo in the image gallery that shows exactly what you’re looking for.     PITCH 1   Climb up to the large ledge, and cut left to the other side of the big tree (fixed rappel tat on the tree, and a couple old bolts just beyond).  Follow precarious looking, but not actually that nasty, stacked blocks up until you find a big ledge, with a short section of more inspiring looking crack/corner climbing above.  Belay here.  Some sources cite a bolted station here, but all I saw was some tat around a natural feature (I think it was a pinch point).  It’s a pretty long pitch, and you could probably find a place for the #5, but it’s kinda too easy to care.   PITCH 2   MP description does a good job with this one.  If you have a #5, you’ll be stoked to place it 10-15 ft above the belay.  Keep going up, climbing kind of whatever, until you can make a move to the right towards a tree (welcome shade) and a pillar of rock (not actually that “weird”).   PITCH 3   First burly pitch of the route.  Really fun climbing, but I actually found it a little bit harder than the famed corner pitches in the upper half of the route - maybe I just bungled part of a sequence, or maybe it was the sun.  Regardless, it’s sweet.  I’m pretty sure I placed both the #4 and the #5 somewhere in the bottom half of the pitch.  As the climbing eases, continue up and left a little bit farther to a comfy ledge.   PITCH 4/5   Best linked.  Follow the left facing corner (it's not as steep as the MP description suggests), until you can traverse left on face holds at the approximate elevation of the ledge/flakes far to your left.  There’s no need to go up, and then back down, the final feature before the traverse.  You’ll pass a bolted belay, but do not stop here.  Keep traversing left, over the flakes, and build a gear belay beneath the obvious, huge, gray corner system.   PITCH 6   Super fun, and true to grade.  The guidebook shows a couple fixed pins down low, but none exist.  Even without them, the protection is good.  Belay at a mediocre stance, with some janky fixed gear (piton and nut equalized with a couple shitty cords, and a crammed 0.75 with nothing attached to it).  This is all easily backed up with gear, I think I used a 0.4.   To be continued...  ","Revelstoke, BC",Yosemite Valley,105862896,5.9+,intermediate,"Sep 30, 2022"

Awesome corner climbing and some wide stemming bring you to a steep bulge with a conveniently located bong to clip near the lip.  A few thuggy moves with mostly good holds get you through.  Climb on top of a small tree (#5 or slingable chockstone for pro).  The chimney / claustrophobic squeeze lay ahead, so this is a good place to clip your shoes or any other bullshit you have dangling from your harness for your second to collect.  I climbed the upper, narrow squeeze right side in, which I think made the exit the easiest.  Get right in there and squirm a few inches at a time, but stay just far enough out so that your helmet doesn’t get stuck inside.  Moving upward isn’t easy, but falling out would be even harder.  About 3 meters above the squeeze, you can build a bomber belay (#2, #3, #4) at a stance with a decent foot ledge.  This puts you in a convenient position to drop a loop down to your second to haul their pack, shoes, helmet, etc. through the chimney.   PITCH 8   Looks pretty chill, but the start has a few tough moves.  Once you’re out of sight of your belayer, you’ll head slightly right to climb a much easier chimney.  There’s an opportunity to place the #5, but it’s not super critical (this is the last time that I placed it on the route).  Belay on an obvious, comfortable ledge at the top of the chimney.  There’s an old bolt and a piton, as well as cracks to place additional gear.   PITCH 9   A relatively short and easy pitch, traversing to the left.  For the second half, you’ll be downclimbing.  Belay on a nice ledge, below the tree, at a stance that allows you to watch your parter well through the downclimbing bit.   PITCH 10   This is where you start to have several options.  One of the MP photos lays out your options well, and we took the “original/standard” route (yellow line), as it sounded the friendliest.  Basically, there are 2 large scale corner / wide crack systems above you to choose from.  We took the left one.  It’s a long pitch, tunnelling through a few trees, pulling on some questionable branches (with pro at your feet, and a ledge below you) at the very end.  Build a gear belay on top of the final tree, beneath a big chimney system.  Despite the trees, the rope drag isn't actually that bad.   PITCH 11   Head up the chimney, it’s pretty chill.  When presented with the option to break out left, take it.  Build a gear belay on a sloping ledge beneath a wide crack in a corner.   PITCH 12   Head up the obvious wide crack/corner (mostly fists).  It’s a bit burly at times.  Once you make it to the top of this thing, all of the hard climbing is over.  Plug a directional for your follower, bust a right, and follow easy ground up to the top of the cliff, where you can belay off of a tree (it’s a ways back, so consider extending your anchor to the lip).   DESCENT   Getting down is pretty easy, and well cairned.  You’ll have to go uphill at least a little bit at the start (even if you don’t want to tag the summit), and almost all of it is walking terrain.  As you drop below the col, there are a few steep-ish 3rd or 4th class downclimbing moves.  At times, you'll be scrambling over fallen trees and boulders, but none of it’s too bad.  Descend straight down for quite a ways, before eventually cutting back left to collect your packs.  If you find the giant talus field that you ascended on the approach, make sure not to go too far down the thing, or you might end up below your bags.

Harder with the wide section...it is definitely the toughest 10a I've ever done. I can't imagine climbing this route in 1964 with no climbing shoes, cams, nuts, or modern equipment. Frank Sacherer was pretty BA.   In the fall 2014 I jumped on this route with my friend Ryan C. I struggled up the 5.8 offwidth start, hung on a cam on the first fingers/lieback section, huffed and puffed up to the good rest stance before the wide hands section, almost completely ranout the wide hands section up to the chockstone because it's so fun and secure, placed a #4 below the chockstone and an offset nut between the chockstone and the wall, then took a 15 footer out of the OW above. I batmanned up to the chockstone and tried several other techniques trying to make progress up the wide crack. The inside of the crack is quite polished and it is difficult to get a good heel/toe to stick on the slick surfaces. I finally committed to stacking a couple fists, pulling up high, and wedging a secure knee in the crack. That's as far as I made it. I slipped down the crack a bit and my knee became painfully wedged in. I was stuck. 15 minutes later, after trying to free myself, I called down to my belayer and friends to call YOSAR. It was pretty humiliating and humbling. My belayer was running down to his truck to get a #6 cam in effort to help me pull myself out while my wife and friends ran down the trail to find cell phone reception in order to call search and rescue. While I was there alone, the anchor tied off below, I begged a prayer to God to help me get out of it. Soon after, I realized that part of the problem was that my right foot was also stuck, which prevented me from being able to shift my knee. I managed to get my shoe off and my foot was free. I stacked fists again above my head, pulled up hard and was able to wiggle my knee free and rest on the rope. When my wife and friends arrived they were relieved and called off the YOSAR team that was on the way. Afterward, everyone was over climbing anymore for the day and I escaped with my tail between my legs, a couple scabs on either side of my knee, and a lost offset nut and 'biner. God answers prayers, even when they are to rescue ourselves from the dumb decisions we make and situations we place ourselves in.   I recently came back to this route for round 2. My buddy Aaron S. floated the 5.8 OW approach pitch, handed me the sharp end, and it was my turn to slay the dragon. I liebacked up the thin crack start and almost peeled a couple times as my left foot smeared on the smooth face left of the line. One might also be able to jam this section using off-fingers jams, but the crack isn't straight in, it cuts into the wall at an angle from right to left, allowing a lieback to be used. I placed a finger sized cam and gunned it for a thin hand jam up high. I made it through the lower section using this strategy of placing gear from the occasional pod hand jam and fighting to the next one. Eventually the crack allowed for solid hand jams up to a good rest ledge. I took a breather there, and asked Aaron S. to tag me up his number 6 (4.5""-7.5"" cam), #3 big bro, and Valley Giant #9 (6""-9"" cam). I hung these on a shouldered sling and left all the other cams and gear I wouldn't need hanging from a cam near the ledge. I then struggled up the off-hands crack, placing and bumping a couple number 3s (wide hand sized cams) along the way, all the while fighting the giant, unwieldy cams that kept swinging in front of me on the shoulder sling. I must have been pretty tired from our attempts on the Steck Salathe and Gold Wall's Silent Line the two days before, because this section felt much harder than it had before. Approaching the chockstone and horizontal crack that mark the beginning of the real fight up the offwidth, I slapped in a #4 (fist sized cam) and clipped the couple bail slings that were already around the chockstone. I then climbed up to a stance atop the chockstone and horizontal crack for a respite before the fight. Reaching high, I placed the #6 deep into the crevice and started offwidthing right side in. I was able to effectively use the knee lock this time for a couple feet which provided a good upper body rest during the start. Fortunately, the number 6 bumped adequately until about 2/3 up the OW where it settled into a tipped-out but secure position. Gasping for breath and sweating away my friction, I planted the Giant up high in the last bit of the wide and thrashed my way up, almost within reach of the exit jug on the left. I wanted so bad to just grab the cam and make the pain go away, but decided to risk the fall and the skin as I was continually slipping back down against the hard won inches whenever I let up on my body tension or breath. Man did it feel good to finally get that jug in hand. As I mantled up to victory my left foot suddenly skated off the smooth left face, as if to say, ""It's not over yet!"" Thankfully, I held on, and stood up to clip the chains. Yesssss. Hardest fought 10a of my life...so far. It's 6 days later and my scraped up right shoulder, right knee, and shins are still getting the Neosporin treatment.   Thank you to Wendy, Ryan, Rudi, Kristina, Aaron, and YOSAR for putting up with my shenanigans on this one.   Needless to say, my offwidth and wide climbing experience and technique is limited, so be ready for a fight if you're not dialed on 5.9 offwidth.  It is possible to do most of the route up to the chockstone (which is outstanding) and bail safely from it below the wide section on this route. There may be slings for bailing already in place, but bring your own along with a quicklink just in case.      Cleaning the Valley Giant #9 on rappel. Cam & photo credit to Aaron Stireman.

My partner took the lead first, and took a small ground fall (his first in the years we've been climbing) on the initial off width section. He had one older camalot #3 placed and had bounce tested it a few times, but must have messed it up it going by because he slipped off just past the piece and it popped out on his way to the ground. I was spotting close and the fall didn't hurt, so he wanted to continue, but much more cautiously.    His head game was not good after the fall, and while there are no crux moves on the crack the climbing is very sustained so he was calling for a lot of takes and really sewing it up. Eventually he made the infamous ""5.8 off width"" at the top, and after going up and backing down a few times finally decided he wasn't feeling good about it.   Now it was my turn to try to slay the demon, and while I wasn't really looking forward to it, I was anxious to actually do some climbing after a long and tedious belay. The initial off width section was pretty easy on top rope, but I was surprised by how physical the lieback and fist jamming above was. None of the moves are harder than 5.10, but the sum is greater than the parts.   When I finally got up to the last horizontal before the chockstone, sweating and cursing, I pulled up to it on a sketchy nut my partner had wedged into the chock stone and started digging the dirt out from behind it with my nut tool. Eventually I was able to get a sling around it, and my last excuse for hanging on the end of the rope was gone. It was time to try to try to climb this thing.   I immediately discovered how awkward it is to get into the off width section. Nothing really felt tight enough to stick a fist in, and I couldn't get enough of my body inside to balance on the chock stone. I tried twisting my foot into the slippery walls and squirming up, but every time I would come right back down more tired than before. Finally, I decided it was my helmet that was the problem keeping me from getting deep enough in to balance, so I took it off and stuck it into the crack. To my surprise, it was the perfect size to jam in the 6"" section and felt like it might allow me to aid my way up to the chains, if it didn't explode first.    Desperate now, I slammed my fist on top of my hapless Vapor helmet (RIP) until it was at knee height. Then, I mustered up the last of my strength to mantel up and stand on top of it and wiggle the last 2 feet until the jug at the top that allows access to the chains. Once we were back on the ground and I pulled what was left of my helmet out of the crack, we decided to lick our wounds and go climb something easier.    As if my day wasn't already strange enough, as I was walking down towards Pine Line for a consolation prize, I suddenly bumped into Alex Honnold walking down the same trail as me. I was too exhausted and new to Yosemite climbing to hazard a guess if this was an unusual occurance or not, so we just walked down the trail for a few minutes while I relayed my harrowing tale of fighting for my life on my first valley off-width. He said he was just rappelling down from the top of El Cap and ""working on some stuff,"" but I was too tired to even try to put that in context with the struggles of an ordinary gumby on his first trip to Yosemite.

Done this way, I honestly felt this was one of the easier sections of climbing on the entire route. My partner didn't agree, but she kept the pack on and climbed it straight in.   And then there's the squeeze in the Supertopo Pitch 5. Easily the worst two feet of progress I've ever attempted to make. Mind-blowingly frustrating. None of the ""classic 5.9+"" offwidths I've climbed even remotely compare to this completely innocuous-looking slot for utter futility and pain.

P10 (ST 14-15) Fun mantle, some wandery bits, one last surpsingly steep bit of 5.9, and a big tree. The steep section feels stout when tired.   P11 (ST 16) To the top!   Descent: took us a bit over 3 hours to the base, onsight. In the dark. With one headlamp. The *excellent* mountainproject beta was a huge help, and, while tedious, the descent wasn't bad at all.   Written down like this, the climb doesn't seem like it could possibly take so much effort to get up. 11 Pitches (same number as NEB of Higher Cathedral Rock), 5.10b, all good belay stances, etc. But, somehow, it does.

I felt this was a good call as the start is not obvious.  The route ascends the right side of the large pillar, not the left as we initially thought.  The first pitch is wide and has a slung chockstone you can see from the base ledge.  From here, with the supertopo topo, we didn't have any other route finding issues even on the descent.   This route is time consuming with many memorable pitches.  The Wilson overhang has excellent gear on the left wall the whole way if you elect to climb it on the outside.  We skipped the squeeze on the next pitch in favor of the 5.8 flake.  Partner led this pitch, there is gear and placing a piece high in the squeeze seemed to help.  Kind of barn doory to get into the flake.     After the bivy ledge the route gets harder and more sustained.  The 5.9 face pitch was amazing, plenty of gear on it really.  Safe if you dont run out of draws like I did and completely miss a bolt staring me in the face.  Long draws are essential as this pitch wanders a bit.  The .10b flare was strenuous, but fun (to follow).     The narrows, what a classic adventure pitch.  Dont go wrong side in (like I did) it makes an already hard pitch waaay harder.  I came flying out after a ten minute struggle, changed directions and was able to get up into the slot with alot less thrutching.  Once you are in, it is not over.  It is helpful to change directions again once standing on the jug midway up.  I figured this out after about an hour long epic struggle cumulating with a slither down the slot to the foot jug.  Knowing what I know now, this pitch will probably feel much more reasonable in the future.  As for which direction to start, ill leave that up to the reader to figure out.  The meat of the narrowd protects well with a 4 or 5 at the start.  I got a finger size piece in higher up and rps in a small crack on the wall in the middle.   The narrows worked me and I belayed just after the squeeze as I was taking wayy too long.  My partner graciously led the second half of the pitch and while easier, it seemed quite scary.   The last few pitches were non-trivial though easier.     We descended in the dark and with all of the excellent information here it was quite manegable though time consuming.  The initial gulley (part 1) is very long and descends almost the entire length of the face.  We opted for a rappel off a tree halfway down.  Part 2 was much shorter but wasnt super scary as we expected.  4th-5.0 downclimbing with manegable exposure.   Cant reccomend this adventure enough, will always remember this one.

After finishing the last pitch you will arrive at the top of The Sentinel from here continue along the ridge towards Glacier Point which is East.  From there you will pick up some Carins.  This will lead you to a point where it looks like you could either go west towards El Cap or East towards Glacier Point.  Keep heading east,  right after turning left you will wiggle between two blocks and pick up and obvious trail.  After following the trail you will get to a gully with a prominent wall that will force you to continue right towards El Cap.  Downclimb some easy 3rd class till you reach this wall and cut back left towards Glacier Point into the main gulley which you will follow all the way until you the reach the stream.  If you keep going right towards El Cap you will most likely die.  I took a nasty slide down a sandy slab before catching a manzanita bush.  Once in the main descent gulley keep following the trail until you come to point where the gully splits off into two plausible options.  You want to stay on the skiers left of the gulley.  If you go right on the more open slabby side you'll get cliffed out.  Once you turn left you will start heading town a slightly loose dirt and pine duff trail, till you come to point where there is rappel tree on skiers right or a low fifth-class down climb on the left.  Either option works it's your call.  After navigating that section continue down the gulley aiming for the stream at the bottom.  Once you hit the stream follow the easiest path to cross the stream until you are in the middle of the gulley that leads down to the valley floor.  Head down the open slab with streams on either side of you.  Eventually you will come to a point where it looks you can't go any further.  Once you reach this point there should be a carin.  Head skiers left towards a block with old rappel tat on it.  Don't rappel off this,  instead work you way down and right towards a small gulley canopied by live oaks and manzanitas.  This gulley will put you onto some more 3rd class slab downclimbing.  Keep heading down and left towards the stream you crossed when you first entered this gulley.  Eventually you will come to point with a bunch of trees and the stream on your left.  Follow the stream through trees until you get fairlly close the the base of Sentinel.  You will cross over a log and cut hard left back towards the the 3rd class mossy ramp on the approach.  You will quickly pick up a distinct trail leading back to the approach trail.

Personally I would recommend folks not try to create, or needlessly memorize, detailed descent descriptions that spend paragraphs explaining how to get through hiking / third and four class terrain.

Worry about making it to the pizza deck before it closes!......lol, that will make you try way harder to find the right way, and will keep you from endlessly looking for a set of bushes or trees that matches some wordy, dubious descent description.   I updated the topo with this descent beta: (both times I climbed the Sentinel we got back to the Four Mile Trail in under an hour).   Steep, technical and loose, do not  attempt the first half of the descent  in the dark. Hike / scramble  south to  enter the steep gully that drops away  to the east (toward Half Dome).  Negotiate this steep gully with some  low fifth class downclimbing, or rappeling,  in spots.

His partner then decided to take the same swing to get to his hurting partner.  I yelled to them and they said they were OK.  They descended from trees and other anchors to the ground.

Serenity crack was originally ""bench mark"" 5.11 when first freed (by guys with thick fingers and kletter shoes) but settled down to 5.10d when that was finally established with EBs (the first friction style slippers) and clean pro that is yes, easier to place than pitons on lead. Over time things change as well due to a normal cycle of rock getting better in the short term (generally cleaner, better beta, loose micro flakes and lichen wear away etc) and then get worse in the long term (holds get polished, chalk caked etc).    The varying opinions on ratings for Sons reflect that. The second pitch is clearly 5.10a if you have larger hands/fingers and know the beta for the OW bypass (lieback to a balancy high step. save a 1"" tcu for a perfect placement in a splitter out left once you get established on the knobs),and use stems for rests etc. Your one 4"" Friend can also be used to protect this section too as well as the top pitch and is worth having, imo. If you think this pitch is 10B go do Gripper, Midterm or (*shudder*) Ahab and re-assess. As posted above if you have thin fingers and uber sticky slippers Serenity is as light a 10d as there is in the Valley. Your mileage will vary on other size cracks higher on the route particularly when your feet are not as happy in those same gym slippers or you are finding insecure jams.   The last pitch has new Beta (walk the plank). When first done it was only envisioned as straight forward thin hands with your feet on the slab. Now that the feet are even better on the slab (lichen/flakes cleaned up) the thin hands at this moderate grade (5.10a) is to be enjoyed. Plus, anyone making it this far should not have a problem. But climb it however you please of course and pass your stoke to others.    Go for the top as the supposed ""runout"" to the bolt is trivial friction and the route is complete when linked to Awahnee Buttress (technically it is an easier variation to this route). The old bad bolt that was there has been replaced and it is perfectly safe. However bring a shovel if you go for the rim via AB or maybe someone will further clean out other perfect cracks up there (Xanadu, 5.8) that would make the finish to the top truly brilliant and a great approach to Crest Jewel.    best   ps Please go for the top of SoY up the easy slab and use the new rap route to the east that starts from the last ledge (pine tree now gone but there are separate bolted anchors all the way to the base of Serenity only needing a 60m rope) to avoid congestion at the trees and resulting damage.

I say this because were trying to trend right on the 2nd rap and got to a reasonable-looking bolt anchor at the base of a dirty chimney (the old Ahwahnee Buttress route?). After trying unsuccessfully to pendulum to either side, I ended up having to do some R rated chimneying and slab climbing to get over to the right rap station before dark.

Think how you felt on Sunnyside Bench, but with sporadic interesting 5.7 layback pitches, a big fun pendulum in the middle, and some delicate slab traverse pitches. And like 4 times longer! I highly suggest simul-climbing every ""pitch"" after the initial chimney, up until the first finger crack past the Manzanita trail. Doing so will allow you to easily pass slow parties and likely bring down your ascent time by a matter of hours.   The route definitely feels “old,” for lack of a better word. You can kinda tell that it was put up in the 1930s, it has a “we just want to get to the top as easily as possible” kind of feel to it. But definitely classic, and it’s nuts to get in 14 pitches in 4 hours. Totally worth doing.   The rappelling was not a huge deal with two 60m ropes. Like maybe 6 or 7 raps total, with a little bit of downclimbing. Definitely exhausting and tedious, but not worth avoiding the route over.   The route-finding can be a bit challenging, for instance at one point the guidebook instructs you to “pick up your rope and walk 150’ to the right through a manzanita jungle until you hit a pin scarred finger crack,” and you’re like 4 pitches up!

Learning what it feels like to be some combination of being too slow, unprepared, tired, injured, lost, hungry, uncomfortable, unlucky, or terrified is a really important experience to have. Are people really having to bail frequently from the first half of Royal Arches? If so I can't really think of a better route to have that experience on.

Josh Janes suggests that this is a very historical route and people have done it for years without such bolts and the climb is close to civilization of help is needed.  The argument opposing this is that over the last 10 years, most of the trees on the route have been dying or in a severe state of decline.  Climbers for generations have been using these trees as rap anchors which have greatly contributed to the death of these trees.  In our striving to climb clean we neglected to preserve the trees.  Certainly a few well placed bolts as anchors on the lower sections are nowhere near as odious as the track of bolts on what has become the rappel route.  I presume that someone who doesn't like a rap route on the lower pitches wouldn't lower themselves to using the normal rappel route.  Having bolts for anchors at selected locations is a good thing to protect the trees and promote climber safety.  ","Santa Rosa, CA",Yosemite Valley,105862881,5.10a/b,intermediate,"Nov 12, 2019"

Scroll the photos to find it, should be easy to follow. Below are the three ways to rap, in ascending order of value.      1) single 60m, either reg or simul rapping. If competent and experienced, simul is fine, otherwise the more experienced goes first to establish the line.     2) 80m, reg or simul. Simul will help, as you will have 4 double station raps w/ an 80. I need to do a topo for this as well, sorry for lagging.     3) IMO the best way, use a 70m on route, and carry a 70 tag (6-7mm) in the pack. I carry a 7.1, 70mm 1/2 rope for this, fits fine in a 25L pack. This results in 4 raps to the huge ledge that leads to the tree/gully walkdown. These will be triple station raps (you will bypass TWO stations) for the first two raps, then double station, then triple station. The 4th rap will get off on a pedestal to climbers R, requiring a 10m downclimb of 5.1 terrain, with no danger factor (unless you walked from station 9-10, then you don't have to do this downclimb- see topo). Untie your ropes here. After walking down the tree gully to the station above P2, do a couple raps (or one, if no water in the P2 gully) to the start of P2.   Now repeat the walk from the chimney (or alt start), in reverse. At the intersection near the bottom, turn perpendicular to the wall and follow the sandy path towards the Alt start. go 25ft from the wall, turn R, walk 10ft, and there is a bomber rap station, which is basically in the middle of a straight line between the top of the chimney, and the top of the Alt start. Do a single rope rap from here (trend climbers L if using a 60m, otherwise 70 is easily on the ground), coil rope, walk back to car.    do NOT use 2x 60m ropes, this is a waste of time, IMO. If all are competent, the raps will take 1:00-1:30. If not, potentially 2:00-2.5hrs. If traffic, potentially 4-5hrs. Plan your start time and/or day you climb accordingly. Enjoy.   addendum: if using double 70m. carry one rope on your non-dominant arm and allow it to spool off as you lead the raps. First two are always fine but I find that the ropes tend to twist around each other by the 3rd/4th rap. Dumping one strand and holding the other will be faster in the long run when you do NOT have to deal with a fustercluck of ropes twisting around each other. First two raps are to be threaded w/ knot on L. 3rd rap should be threaded w/ knot on R, and 4th should be knot on L again.  ",Morro Bay,Yosemite Valley,105862881,5.10a/b,intermediate,"Apr 13, 2021"

On p4 we also took the right variation with the sweet hand crack.  p6+7: the money pitch! The upper half of p6 is an excellent hand crack that turns into a double hand crack for incredible fun. Linked with p7 up to the base of the OW for a rope-stretcher of a pitch.  p8: Heel-toe walked up the OW. The flakes above are a fun jug haul, though I was careful with weighting the large hollow sounding flake.  p10: 5.4 traverse. Most of this pitch was wet. I placed gear in cracks covered by sheets of running water, made for a hilariously unique and adventurous-feeling pitch. The (dry treated) rope got totally soaked. Still easy enough climbing to get across without issue, and the rope was surprisingly dry again by the end of the next pitch.  p11+12: linked. Took the 5.7 steep hands variation on p12. The last few moves before the tree on p11 combined with the steep hands on p12 distinctly felt like the hardest moves on the route to me, but maybe the latter is just because I had quite a bit of rope drag after the move out left. Passing the p11 tree on the left instead of the right would help to reduce drag if linking.   Erik Sloan's rappel route beta came in handy, though I think some of the rap lengths are a bit off. The only routefinding part that wasn't super straightforward to me was finding the 13th rap station after scrambling down the gully.

Another party provided a headlamp to get to the bivy safely, to rest and take the descent trail in the morning. Another problem, we didn't have any backup clothing, but a climber rapping off Crest Jewel got us an emergency blanket. I would offer some advice:   1. Bring backup long-sleeve clothing, wind jackets, XL emergency blanket, headlamps and backup batteries for headlamps  2. Plan for slow parties adding time. 30-45 minutes per slow party per pitch was the pace that day  4. The descent trail at night has dangerous scramble sections and dummy trails. Just rest and wait for morning  5. Pitches 4, 6, 7 to pebble beach dont offer good passing options, so try to pass parties before here!  6. The bivy is a pretty sweet rest area for a memorable evening if you are prepared properly. The spring water is crisp/fresh and didnt make our party sick afterwards   For the descent trail, when you get to Washington column, do not head along the cliffside. There are dummy trails that lead you to sheer drop-offs. Instead walk directly towards the base of North Dome and then traverse along the base towards the gully. The gully itself has several entrances, but keep walking as far climber's right as possible towards the dirt trails that lie on climber's right of the slab river. The low-angle slab river itself is fine, but the dirt on climber's right is the suggested route. It took us about 2 hours just to get from Washington Column to base of the slab river that runs through the gully  ","Portland, OR",Yosemite Valley,105862881,5.10a/b,intermediate,"Oct 9, 2023"

The top anchors can be reached by a fun 5.9 variation around the corner to the right that is worth doing in its own right (I'd give it 2-3 stars). Bring pro through #4 BD C4 and be prepared for some sustained & steep jamming, with occasional surprise stems to keep things reasonably easy. There is a little loose rock that is easy to avoid, and a fun lieback on a hollow flake (1-2 #2 C4s) that transitions to a bear hug & mantle to finish.   The second 5.8 pitch above Stone Groove is a LOT harder than the 5.9 approach pitch and it is not hands (well maybe the first part is). It is a very tight & flaring squeeze chimney that takes good elbows-up chikenwinging. There is no pro except for sliding a #6 BD C4 until you reach the chockstone near the top (takes a #1 BD C4?). If you have good flexibility you can reach around and place a small cam in a dirty seam behind you to backup the #6, though it might not hold much of a fall. The #6 is barely large enough to protect as it is slid along or re-set beyond the wider parts. The crux is getting through where the chimney widens just before the chockstone. This pitch was short but burly and very worth doing! (3 stars) Bring minimal pro, as gear definitely gets in the way leading this pitch.   Rap anchors for the 5.8 P2 are old and need replacing.

Moral of the story: bring a lightweight rain jacket with a hood on long routes like this, it might save your life.   Either CJ or CJD linked with Royal Arches makes for a lovely day out.

RA to CJD is no joke!   Some beta: when approaching the direct start, it is farther left than you think. As others point out, it's left of the giant right facing book (which is left of the giant roof and arch).    Socks saved my butt on this one. Halfway through CJ my feet were so sweaty they were soaked and sliding around in my moccs. This meant very awkward foot placement but it also rubbed my toes raw. Slapped on some socks, and felt like I just gained super powers from the better fit, and it helped mitigate the funk.   Off route potential: pitch 3 of originional line: the second bolt is NOT AT THE END OF THE DIKE. It's only like 10 or 15 feet down the dike past the first. Don't do what did and run it out 150 ft and then have to reverse! Cool dike though...   Also, on pitch five (of original line), when you get to the last bolt, look straight up and only like 10 ft. The anchor is not on that giant, sexy looking dike way up high it on one that you can barely make out from where you are. I would also argue that it is directly above you, and not up and left as topo suggests. Resist the urge to go way left to find a way up to the siren dike only to find yourself about 25 ft left of and level with the anchor. And you do have to downclimb that part to correct.   Oh yeah, and check the weather forecast. Those mono winds blow hard! Hard enough to knock you completely over when your balancing on one foot pad and touching the wall with your fingertips.

RR had just arrived for a quick trip with Jeff and his idea for an outing with the four of us, was Rawl Drive on Lembert Dome Appropriately the only real pitch followed a line of widely spaced bolts up the handsome west face of Lembert, after negotiating a rib lower down after the first belay. With RR leading off over the horizon in fabulous blue skies, and Jeff then also disappearing, Bridwell and I, being the youngsters of the group and certainly the self-styled bad boys, were left alone briefly to hone our skills of abject ridicule. You see, by this point, August 1971, we both knew RR and Jeff were just grand old men and had had to give up their reins to us squirts who certainly would know how to finally kick the horse in the flanks.    So toward this end, Bridwell performs, entirely for my benefit at our smidgeon of belay spot, and realize, very close at hand since he was tied to Jeffs trailing line and anchored at our belay, a hilarious mocking of RRs showboating style of face climbing. Lots of stepthroughs with uncanny hops, operated at a frequency far beyond what RR had performed but indicative of the wasteful and exhibitionistic quality they had had, say maybe ten stepthrough hops within 25 seconds, reminiscent of Irish clog dancing. He went on to add for me, several very alert memorable and classic RR facial profiles requiring he also flare the hell out of his nostrils and do RR eyes, as if to signify that in the beautiful alpine scene below us he as RR had sensed the Larger Picture from our aerie. As he actually began to follow the pitch, he continued this comedic routine with other Stony Point maneuvers, with lots of complicated back stepping, and a pronounced butt-outward posture to technically diminish the effect of the rocks angle and add the last possible bits of fun to our skit. We had seen it all, and now we were having fun. It was one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed Bridwell do. It was somewhat born of affection for Royal but it also was to call a spade a shovel, I have to think. Anyway our shenanigans ended, RR never knew and thus would never be hurt by it and there went a couple of hours in the Meadows.    But Jim and I werent done. We salvaged what was left of our productive day and roared back down to the Cookie area 50 miles away leaving the old farts with their memories, rappelled the soon-to-be Wheat Thin, and checked out this phenomenal formation. We were roped on and over the edge within an hour and half of leaving the Meadows.    Wheat Thin, on the Nabisco Wall, was not thought of as something a climber from Good Society would have bothered with. The silly thing is about 1 thick mostly, a flake so thin that in its expanse has many actual weathered through-and-through holes in its face as it stands mostly detached about 100 ft high above the actual Cookie top. And when I had been over in this area climbing, I of course had seen it, as everyone else had, and it did not even occur to me that it was a possible climb. What it looked like was mere ugliness and non-being---Nonclimbing, really, which can fill many climbing areas, especially 35 years ago.    But Bridwell, in his March to the Sea, had noticed it and had decided we were going to make this thing happen somehow, so that other climbers could not have it. Kind of how Richard Pryor says, Women, theyre weird, they buy shoes so that other women cant have them. And so over we go, bolts and hangers at the ready, and place a few really ugly, hideously protruding 1/4 compression units in the vertical cliff wall just to the left of this piece of granite paper shuddering on the wall, while taking out a few razor-edged flakes staked in the crack here and there. Bridwell did most of this as I hung out above him.    I am looking at him, he is wonderfully garbed in his all-white full-sleeved shirt and pants, but he is not happy. He is hammering away at the drill, but way fast, and doesnt seem to be enjoying anything anymore. We had been having such fun. The drill in those days was not carbide and would narrow out and bind quickly. The bolts are bottoming out too soon. I dont know. With him it could be anything. But eventually he clues me in. And then I see some blood, its near his crotch, lets me know his hemorrhoids are killing him. And he is in white.    So in the spirit of our raucous day that had begun in the Meadows, I take a motherly tone with him hanging 50 feet below me, trying to soothe him, advising my daughter about how this kind of thing happens to young ladies around this age, that it would become a regular thing, and that he should not be afraid it is just the weeping of the disappointed uterus. And he enjoys this new riff, jugs up, and I finished the last messed up bolt and we are out of there. So in a matter of an afternoon, Wheat Thin became the first rap-bolted climb in the Valley, only because it was such a fragile wildly expanding structure, and ironically authored by extreme trad climbers.    We instantly went back the next day I recall, and started to climb our monstrosity. Since it was Jims idea, as we stand on top of the Cookie, he leads off way to the right on a flake ledge to access the incipient crack that runs up to the actual defined left facing 1-4 thick lieback flake. He has hammered the sh#t out of a Long Dong trying to get it into the meager bottoming crack; there is nothing between him and I besides this and he tries to develop the moves above this A3-quality placement to reach our fancy flake.    He hates it; the situation is unexpected because the day before we had just looked at the flake higher up and not how to get into it. After about 30 minutes he actually backs off, gives me the lead. I am sure he was not at par either with his hemorrhoids. My advantage of course was that I did not drive the one and only point of protection between us, so I did not understand how it probably would not have held a real fall. I beat it a little, didnt love it but went ahead anyway. So bold and ignorant, I established these fairly hard 5.10c barn-door moves to the flake, thinking that they were gross, inconvenient, and just in the way of our special-assed flake rather than the actual beef of the whole route. Climbing onwards to the top of Butterballs for the belay, I encountered nothing as difficult as this technical start I had just done and had actually kind of gotten bored tippy-toeing around this dangerous thin feature for a hundred feet. Jim swarmed up the route, and we were off.    It turned out during subsequent ascents years later, a couple serious falls took place at the beginning, and that although it was to become a unique airy three-star route, the thing was nobodys little plaything. It was just put up by clowns.   ",,Yosemite Valley,105871252,5.10c,intermediate,"Oct 9, 2006"

Every time we arrived at a cliff, there was a rap anchor right there.  Although they were easy to find, they were also a bit sketchy.  One of the rap anchors consisted of two rusted bolts that wiggled like loose teeth, and the hangers on both bolts were smashed completely flat from rockfall, so it was impossible to replace the somewhat worn looking webbing connecting them together.  Fortunately there was a third bolt that looked good, but was missing a hanger.  We were able to cinch a wired stopper over this bolt and equalize this to the other sketchy anchor, which made me feel a little better on rappel.

When we were halfway through the raps, the party behind us was already scrambling down the gully.  We didn't end up with an epic descent, just spent more time getting close with biting ants than necessary...  ","Oakland, CA",Yosemite Valley,105915125,5.10c,intermediate,"Jun 18, 2010"

The bolted rap anchors sucked, as advertised.   Personally, I'd avoid doing this route until later in the season the gully was snow and (mostly) water free.  Even in October our ropes got somewhat wet on the first rappel. I imagine in early to mid-season it is a waterfall, and snow in the gully would be somewhat epic I imagine.

We had 2x60m ropes, and were able to bail down fine doing P7+6 in one rap from the piton (new and shiny, looked really solid, backed up for the first climber, but leaving gear might be a good idea), then a slight diagonal across pitch 5 from bolts, and from there P4+3 and P2+1 rap easily from bolts down to the ground. Total gear left: 1 locking caribiner on the piton at the top of P7.

The Regular Route is perhaps the most enjoyable (5.9 move + A0 or 5.10c), and the 50 Crowded Var. is a little tricky & thin (small cams & extend), plus a bit run-out through the 5.6/5.7 face above.  Good climbing though.   A couple notes to augment the SuperTopo.  It is worth trying to skip the belay at the top of P7 - it takes pretty small gear to back up the pin there, and is a small stance.  You can reach top of P8 with a 70m, or there is a good belay just about 30 feet above the top of P6 belay, then you can reach w/ 60m.    Lastly, the left hand 5.10a to 5.9 variation at the top of the route, exiting the 5.7 groove on the left, I found to be really enjoyable and maybe some of the better climbing on the route.  I'm lost with the grades though - I would describe this section as a 5.8 move into the finger crack out of the groove and climb up past a flake to the tree, then above to a 5.8 move steeping left (5.10a in SuperTopo), then up the right leaning crack - a 5.7 layback (5.9 hand traverse in SuperTopo? - seems easy).

Second, the rap stations are super scary--tat tied to teeny bushes covered in ants (which we backed up with a nut and a sling), more tat tied to a large boulder that's not attached to anything....   What's worse is that every party that day wound up using that scary rappel, and it's a wonder nothing came down.   So if you see tat around the tree, turn around.

I found the distance descriptions in Supertopo to feel a bit off, but the play by play was fairly accurate.

There's a few tricky moves).    2.  We headed right to the 50 crowded after the bolted pitch.  It's a little runout there to a pin, then delicate edgy climbing with small gear here and there over to the start of P7.   It wasn't terrible but a fall on most of this traverse pitch would pendulum pretty far or pull out crummy gear.  Gotta just be careful and keep going.  3.  Maybe I was just pumped when I got to P10, but I thought about 30 feet leading up to the first tree with rap rings (end of this pitch) was super hard and runout.  Maybe I went the wrong way - face climbing with almost no gear and small nubs for hands and feet.  Seemed in the 10's with almost no gear until a crack 30' or more up.  I felt like I basically soloed this part.  Curious if anyone else went this way.   Decent Beta:  We ended up doing the ""walk off"" because after over an hour of searching we never found the first set of rap rings that are apparently 20' left and 6' down from the tree with slings.  That would have been nice...   For the decent you climb to the second ledge with a tree with slings, this one was the one full of ants.  This is the first point where you can see yourself potentially unroping and scrambling (we belayed).  You then head up the gully to climber's right.  Eventually you come to a 20' or so rock blocking the gully and have to climb over it, stand on top, then climb DOWN the other side.  You should now be at a point where the wall is on your left and you walk around a path to your left.  There is a tree here you can belay from if you are still roped up.  We belayed this last pitch.  Look down from the tree and a little to the left and you will see a cairn of sorts.  This marks the start of the decent (starts 10-15 feet below and left of the tree), but you still have to go up around 50-70 feet once you get to this lower path.  Get down to this path the easiest way then eventually come to about a 45 degree incline.  Trees, a little scrambling and climbing, will get you to the top of this.  Now you can see slabs (lots of pebbles and such on them) in front of you.  Across the slabs, straight and a little down, are more cairns.  Get across here CAREFULLY (we roped up).  Now you are on more of a trail that you just have to follow cairns and mostly stay in the brush away from the edge all the way around to the massive gully.  You will know when you get there, it's a dead end with nowhere else to go but down.  The first set of rap anchors are NOT on climber's right.  The gully kind of has two gullys at the top that combine into one 50 or so feet lower down.  The first set of rap anchors is on climber's LEFT of these paths.  When hiking down the top of the gully (looking down) go all the way to the RIGHT side, then start looking on your left.  There was only one bolt, the other had been smashed off by a rock.  I added a #5 nut and sling to the anchor.  The next anchor is the chock stone 90' further down.  You reach this with a 60.  I added a sling and biner to the pile of old brittle webbing.     I felt the decent was more adventurous than the climb itself and took us forever.  The climb was 5 stars all day long but to echo other climbers here I would opt for the rap route if I would have found it.

Care full midway up the 1st pitch below roof, a LOT of lose blocks/rocks, climb gingerly through here.   Link 3/4: Moves look scarier than it is passing the 2 pitons, but holds are jugs and movement easily up considerably after the ""loose flakes."" Make sure you extend your pieces around the ""loose flakes"" to prevent rope drag for the rest of the long link up. Crack system wanders right than back left.   We didn't link pitch 5 and 6 because of it seemed to wander to much. My buddy aided most of the bolted section. We suck at slab. For the leader, after the last bolt, try to place your next piece as high as possible, consider bumping or back cleaning for follower. After I unclipped the last bolt I had a swing/pendulum to the left since route and the next piece was pretty far left.    pitch 6: As per fish topo and other topos, it shows first piton pretty up and far right of the belay. Piton is more towards above the anchors on the right side of the ledge. There's two bolted anchors for pitch 6. No need for any big gear here. Mostly finger size to C3 size cams to protect your follower during the traverse.   Link pitch 7/8 (pitch 4 of Fish topo). Bring all the slings you have. We had 12 or 13 slings on us and I wished I had 1-2 more even after running it out on parts of the routes. I would definitely recommend simul climbing about 30ft so you can get to the next big ledge to belay on. The top of pitch 7 is a little ledge and seems very uncomfortable as well as other anchor set up near the top of pitch 8. The first part of pitch 7 is pretty mellow so leader shouldn't be to scared of being pulled down. I didn't see this part of the topo or else I would've brought by micro traxion. I used a #2, .75 and .4 for my anchor.   link 9/10: pretty straight forward. Climb to the huge ledge to where the bolted anchors are to climbers far left for the rappel.

The third rap station was rather tricky for me to spot, so I wanted to call it out to hopefully save a few folks a little bit of time: when rappelling from the second station, descend about 20 meters, you'll arrive at a ledge with a small tree (it's a fairly obvious stopping point), when standing on the ledge, look up and climbers left around a slight corner, and the third rap station is just around this corner, about 10 feet above the base of the tree. From there, you descend down into the gully and the stations are all very obvious. A few of the raps are rather short, but I would only recommend linking raps if you have a tagline or are using an 80m rope. I don't think linking any of the raps would be possible with a 70m.   All told the raps took us about 2.5 hours, and that was with the tree raps, some gratuitous rope management, a single 70m, and searching for the third rap station. If you rappelled from the proper start and moved at a normal pace with a 70m, you could pretty easily be down in 90 min.     Hope this helps!

See the overlay image on the Supertopo site (not yet resized for posting here), but now instead of going to the ledge with the dying tree that gets you to the top of Serenity Crack there is another station to the right that allows a short rappel to the next station right above Mother of the Future (crack line to the East of Serenity crack) on Sunset Ledge.    This station on eastern Sunset Ledge sends you down MoF completely separate from all parties on Serenity and serves as an excellent rap route from that route as well to avoid the cluster. It starts on the lip of Sunset Ledge above and east of Serenity (clearly visible and safely reachable) and then has a short first rappel to a good stance, uses an established anchor on MoF, then uses a Pigs in Space/Firefingers anchor, then another new anchor on a dike/ramp and then to the top of the first pitch anchor of Maxine's Wall/Firefingers and from there to the ground.    All are done easily with one 60m rope or in 3 rappels with two ropes.

That pro advice rang true for our onr camming unit, and that climb kicked my ass: landing the perfect, cupper hand jam at the top was like getting a big breath of air after getting window shaded in a keeper hole.

The first seven pitches of this climb are superb.  After that, the route becomes somewhat discontinuous, dirtier, and less aesthetic.  There is plenty of fun climbing above the seventh pitch, but you have to work a little harder for it.  Besides their high quality, another nice feature of the first seven pitches is that they stay shaded into mid-afternoon, so even on a warm summer day, it was pretty comfortable.  We climbed into the sun when we pulled onto the top of the seventh pitch and it stayed with us the rest of the way.   There is a topo in the new Yosemite guidebook, which is what we used and found it to be accurate.   Approach: You can approach this climb from the bottom or from the ledge at the top of the fourth pitch.  The second option is really nice because you can leave food and water at the ledge.  The top of the fourth pitch is about 50 yards past the start of Voyager.  As of June 2016, there is a fixed line along the last section of the ledge, which is a little exposed.  There are also fixed lines going all the way down to the start of the first pitch, so you can rappel down without even having to uncoil your rope.  If those fixed lines disappear, you can rappel down with a single 70 m rope.   Pitches 1-4 (10d, 10, 10a, 10a) climb up the crack system back to the ledge.  These pitches are pretty short, so you can easily link pitches 1 and 2, as well as 3 and 4.   Pitch 5 (11a/b) is a sweet finger and hand crack, with a short section of fist or offwidth toward the top that can be laybacked.  From the bolted anchor of p5, you’ll be able to see the first bolt of p6 to your left.  Traverse over, reaching blindly for good holds that will take you up to that bolt, then onto a short layback section (10d) which turns into a perfect, cruiser hand crack that brings you to another bolted anchor.  Looking up, you’ll see the long, splitter crack of p7 (11a/b).  This is thin hands for most of the way, gradually narrowing to fingers.  As the crack starts to dissipate, some handholds will appear on the left.  You’ll follow these around the arête, at which point you may see some fixed lines off to the left.  Don’t be lured by those, they’re for another route.  Instead, follow the corner leading up and slightly to the right, and you’ll soon see another bolted anchor.  From here, you can either rap down to the ledge (a single 70 m would work), or continue upward.   Pitch 8 (5.8) follows cracks up and to the right, past a large tree and onto a large ledge.  Belay off a tree with slings and a rap ring.  The topo says p9 is 5.6, but we just unroped and scrambled up the ledge system to the base of two wide cracks.  I didn’t feel that unroping for this pitch was dangerous or exposed.  For p10, the right crack starts as hands and soon widens to a squeeze chimney (10a), which is actually pretty fun as far as squeeze chimneys go.  Follow the chimney system up to another large ledge with a big tree, then climb up another 20 feet or so to a bolted anchor.   Pitch 11 (10d) starts off with some slabby moves on polished rock, and eases up as you go past several bolts to another bolted anchor.  Pitch 12 (10a) takes you into another crack system.  My partner got off route midway up this pitch by staying in the right wide crack, which is tempting but turns out not to be a good option.  Instead, pull around to the left, into a crack that takes hand jams good gear.  There is also a bolted anchor at the top of p12.  A final short pitch up blocky and mostly easy terrain takes you to the top, where you can belay off a huge tree.   Descent: From the top of p13, you can walk off, but I don’t know how to do that or where it takes you.  What we did was rappel back down to the top of p10.  There we did a short rappel over to the right, to the top of Voyager, and rappelled down Voyager.  All of these raps can be done with a single 70 m rope.  You could also just rappel the route, but it would probably be annoying to rappel through the ledges of p8 and p9.  Also, I’m not sure all of p8-p10 are 35 meters or less.   Rack: The topo recommends nuts, a double set of cams .3” to 3” and singles 3” to 5”.  We didn’t place any nuts, and we also didn’t place the #5 c4 we brought.  The only place you might want the #5 is on the p10 squeeze chimney, but it’s not necessary.  If, like me, you really like to sew things up, an extra .75 and #1 could be handy for the long crack on p7.  Other than that, the pitches are short, so anything more than a double set of cams (and quickdraws/slings) is just extra weight.  ",,Yosemite Valley,111928132,5.11-,advanced,"Jun 29, 2016"

When you're tired of getting stressed out on those other big grade IVs, Fifi Buttress is a good place to relax and enjoy some comfortable climbing.   Linking pitches as mentioned above is easy and has the added benefit of skipping some really uncomfortable hanging belays. We linked 1+2, 3+4+5 with a 70 though 5 may be better done on it's own, 6+7, 8+9, 10, 11+12, 13. I would highly recommend linking pitch 6 with the pitch 7 splitter just after, that way you're climbing ledge to ledge and get 40ish meters of splitter. I would've placed a third .75 if I had it cause I'm a seamstress, but I didn't, so I didn't. It's that simple! Just say no to hanging belays.   It's worth climbing above pitch 7 at least once because 1) that's the route and 2) P10 is rad. Savor the chimney.   You can rap from the summit all the way down the route with a 70m rope. This involves one rap off a huge bomber slung flake at the top of P10, and most likely a rap off a tree on one of the dirtaneering pitches, otherwise follow the chains. Be very, very careful while rappelling and pulling ropes through all the dirty ledges, they are quickly eroding and there is a lot of loose rock to come down. Downclimbing pitch 9 and maybe 8 wouldn't be a bad idea to mitigate this.   Lastly, there are indeed some superfluous bolts on this route, maybe several, but nothing outrageous. Many of the bolts that are adjacent to good gear placements keep the rope away from sharp edges and the climber away from hollow features, some may not appreciate this routefinding decision being made for them but it is a sign of a lot of thought being put into the route.

While at the end of the pitch anchor, I was looking across the slab toward The Salathe route, and I thought it looked free climbable. I probably mentioned it to John, but we had no bolt kit to try it with.   I went back a few days later with Mike Graham, and he led the roughly 50’ traverse to the Salathe with two or three bolts, a good runout or two, and some really thin, hard slab  climbing.   We continued and found the following pitches to be straight forward and easier than the traverse.    I got the lead on Robbins’ bolt ladder pitch. I did the standard traverse left to where Royal began aid bolting up and right across the smooth slab. I easily freed past two or three bolts, and then it got blank. Rather than trying to push the line of his aid bolts, I looked around for a natural weakness, and saw a possibility out right. I was able to traverse to a good hand hold, and mantel it. This put me about 10-15’ out from the last bolt. I placed a new protection bolt, and was able to free straight up to the last bolt of Robbins’ original ladder. This free variation eliminated about 5 of his aid bolts.   As I belayed Mike from the ledge below the Half Dollar, it seemed he was taking a long time to follow the pitch. It was odd to me because the climbing wasn’t that hard and he was an ace slab climber. I couldn’t see him climbing because the whole slab changes to lower angle above the bolt ladder, and he was on the steeper part below.   When he finally appeared he was grinning ear to ear, and let out a loud “whoop!” His long hair was blowing up in the wind, the afternoon sun lighting him up on the skyline against the deep shadow of El Cap Meadow. Like a Native American warrior with a string of scalps, he victoriously held up a runner with a cluster of Royal’s bolts and hangers dangling.   “Oh shit!” I thought. We were 18 yr old punks, and Mike just chopped “The Royal” bolt ladder!   I had no idea he was doing it, and although I was shocked, I understood why he did.    This was only a couple of years after Royal climbed Harding’s Wall of the Early Morning Light, with the intention of making an ethical statement about excessive bolting on El Cap by chopping the route.    In a nutshell, if Royal thought Warren’s bolts were unnecessary,  Mike felt that we had proven Royal’s to be also unnecessary, and worthy of the same treatment!   Royal had famously claimed that his Salathe Wall route was “the greatest rock climb in the world”.  For the line, of course, but the line of Harding’s Nose Route certainly rivaled The Salathe Wall, or clearly surpassed it, by most climbers’ estimation.   The thing Royal was most proud of in that era of ethical purity was the low bolt count of, I believe, only 13 used on the First Ascent.   We eliminated about half of them that day. I never went back - I had already done the Salathe Wall, when I was 17 in 1972. I had some regrets as far as how following parties would deal with the blank slab, when the original free rating of the route was 5.9, but obviously they have worked it out somehow.   I heard Royal was a bit miffed about it, but he set the standard.  ","La Jolla, Ca",Yosemite Valley,105991737,5.11,advanced,"Nov 29, 2019"

Save your best offset cams and nuts for just before the crack peters out and you have to run it out to the 1st bolt. The climbing is hard right there, I barely kept my act together, and my last 4 or 5 pieces, while stitched up, were all unlikely to hold. I had burned up my two offset cams too early and didn't bring offset nuts/brassies. I won't repeat that mistake.  I might sound like a punter for this, but in those final irregular pin scars I think the tricams might be ideal.  Pitch 5 is 130', not 120' like in the guidebook, so when we bailed after this pitch I was happy to have the 80 meter and avoid some sketchyness. Cant' wait to go back and work the roof moves and the slab moves.  Amazing route, psyche is up :)  ",San Francisco,Yosemite Valley,105991737,5.11,advanced,"Dec 6, 2020"

I would do this again, but would probably wear climbing shoes for it.  Done this way the 10a part of the first pitch ends up being very short and it would make sense to continue right on into the easy variation of the Boulder Problem pitch.  If doing the traditional, harder variation (11c), a belay is necessary due to the traverses.  I thought the harder variation was quite good and would whole-heartedly recommend it.     The Enduro Corner was much steeper than I expected but (the corner itself was) also much shorter than I expected.  There is a complete no-hands rest halfway up the business section which takes the Enduro out of the equation.   Next to Changing Corners, the Harding Slot was my favorite pitch on the climb.  Bring a 0.5 and #3 Camalot, and 2 each 0.75, #1, and #2 Camalots.  Nothing else (and ditch it all by the time you've entered into the slot!) or pay the price.  I dangled these pieces, along with a belay device and a locker for the anchor, from a long runner girth-hitched to a gear loop.  This worked nicely.     The harder variation on P7 felt contrived.   P10 is very scary when you're tired.  Take a long breather on the ledge before it if you have the time.   Tim DeRoehn recommended the following rack to us, which we used, and was PERFECT:   1 ea. from Black Alien to #4 C4 (#3.5 Camalot)  2 ea. from 0.5 to #3 Camalots  Single set of wires & RP's.  10 slings/draws.   This rack doesn't allow you to sew the climb up (e.g. mild back-cleaning on the Enduro Corner, some walking of gear on the upper part of Changing Corners and the following pitch), but we felt OK with it for our first time on the route, and it was nice to go fairly light.   Awesome climb!  The Rostrum is closer to the perfect climb in terms of quality, but Astroman packs in some wicked exposure (moreso than any other free climb I've done) and a lot of adventure.

Here are a few bits of information that might be useful:   - You can definitely get down from the top of the enduro corner with a single 70 meter rope. The day before we climbed the entire route we did Astroboy as a warm up. You can do a short rap from the main ledge on top of the enduro corner to hit an intermediate anchor in the 5.7 chimney. From there it is about 34 meters to the base of the corner, tie knots in the rope. So it should be possible to get down from the top of the Harding Slot with a single 70.   - Having climbed both the 5.11 boulder problem pitch and the 5.10 direct variation, I have to agree that the 5.10 makes more sense with the flow of the route. In fact you can get to the base of the enduro corner in one pitch - it is possible to link the 5.7, 5.10a and the final direct 5.10 to the base of the corner in 70 meters, just watch the rope drag and consider having the second simul-climb a bit. This could be good beta to get past a slower party starting out. All this said, I think everyone should give the 5.11c variation a try, it is good fun!   - Climb the Harding Slot with the left side in. We went into the slot having heard right side in was the way to go, now we know on good authority that we did it the wrong way! To get into the slot, climb the easy staircase crack, do the strenuous layback section (not as bad as it looks) to a good resting stance, make sure you've got a .75 and #1 Camalot left on your rack. Commit to tight hand jamming and just go for it. Eventually you will get to two little ""jugs"" in the jam crack. Get the top one with your left hand and then open up your body and commit to the left side in chimney. Don't overthink it, just go for it! And the fall is really, really clean.   - For rack, we had: handful of offset and regular nuts, single set TCUs, double run of BD cams .3 to #3, extra .75 and #1, single #4 Camalot. We were happy with that rack.   - The enduro corner begins to go into the shade around 11:30am or so when we were there (early June).

P1: 5.7 scramble  Don't place any gear on this pitch at all if you want to link through p2 up to the base of the Boulder Problem in one pitch, which would be the better than pitching it out. I placed two pieces on p1 and found there to be too much rope drag when reaching the 10a lieback section on p2 to comfortably link the pitches. As of 4/16, p1 was mostly dry with a wet section toward the end, but that section has good jugs.   P2: 10a lieback  The 10a lieback is short and a lot of fun. If wanting to do the Boulder Problem for p3 rather than the straight up 5.10 face climbing variation, make sure the p2 leader continues left, past the 2 bolt anchor at the base of the 10a bypass variation, to the start of the boulder problem. Otherwise you will lose time having to move the belay over 15 feet or so. The belay at the bottom of the boulder problem takes BD 0.75 in a downward, horizontal crack at your feet. As a result, the belayer will be on the slab below this.   P3: 11c Boulder Problem or 10a direct bypass face climbing variation  The lower section is currently protected by a bomber lost arrow piton (I hung and fell on it). Stand up high on the small block at the base to reach and clip it. I had DMM Peenuts and had no success in getting them to stick in lower part of the seam. A purple Metolius cam (size 0) fits nicely higher up the seam. The Boulder Problem felt about V5 for me and is a block separated from the main wall by a very thin, right leaning crack/seam. You use the pin scars and wider sections of the seam as crimps. Look for small crystals for the feet both right and left of the seam. Toward the top, get your left hand as high as possible in order to reach/span up to the next good hold with the right hand. It's not over after the top of the boulder; a short 5.10 traverse on edges awaits to gain the crack out right. Be sure to place gear (yellow C3 or 0.3 BD) at the top of the boulder to protect the traverse and the follower.   P4: Enduro Corner  This is a quite appropriately named pitch. There aren't any stopper moves, they just stack up over time. Being able to utilize the right face with the feet seems like a key to efficiency. The reason is that the right face is less than vertical while the left face overhangs, leaning to the right. As a result, when you jam straight in to the crack (which goes into the left face), you're climbing an overhanging crack, while if you lieback or use the right face for the right foot, you're climbing a less than vertical crack. Body english on your left side helps. The long section of off-finger width is brutal; just hang in there. A thumb-bridge or ringlock can work for the left hand through that section. Then the crack thins a bit more for some sustained liebacking.    P5: Easy 5.8 hands to 5.9 hands in short overhang. #3 protects bottom of overhang and #2 protects the top. Beware the loose flakes below the short overhang. Cool, comfortable stance at the top of this pitch.    Pro (only specific to first 5 pitches):   We took the recommended Supertopo rack, doubles from purple Metolius 0/BD C3 00 to BD # 3, 1 extra each of 0.5, 0.75, 1 & 2 BD to make triples of those sizes, 1 # 4 BD, DMM aluminum offset nuts, DMM Peenuts, # 1, 2, & 3 BD stoppers (smallest ones), and 7 alpine draws. Single 70m rope.   No BD #4 cam was needed for the first 5 pitches. Only a single BD #3 was used. Triples of BD 0.75 and #1 and were helpful for the Enduro Corner; triples of BD 0.5 and 2 were not needed. Only a single purple Metolius 0 was used. The gray Metolius 00 was not used but may be useful for the Boulder Problem. I think we used only 2 draws on any of the first 5 pitches. You could probably forego bringing any nuts banking on the piton being there to protect the Boulder Problem; micronuts would be needed to protect the lower part of it otherwise.   Getting Down:   Only a single 70m rope was needed for rappelling from the top of p5. From the top of p5, rap to the intermediate/lower anchor near the Enduro Corner's chimney section. From there, rap to the base of the Enduro corner with a small swing left to gain the anchor. From the bottom of the Enduro corner rap to the bottom of p2 near the large pine tree. From there rap to the ground.   We planned to also climb p6 but couldn't tell if it was possible to rap from the top of p6 with a single 70m rope. Looking at it from the top of p5, there appeared to be a single bolt at the halfway point (as indicated in the Supertopo) and no ring.   Make sure to hit up Jo Jo (10b) on the way out for a good cool down climb.  ",,Yosemite Valley,105845493,5.11c,advanced,"Apr 19, 2016"

DMM offset nuts blue 8 & red 9 work. (~equivalent to BD Stoppers: yellow 8, blue 9)   Draws - 7 draws, at least 4 (maybe 5) should be extendable   Gear beta   P1 - Save a 0.4 Camalot for a crack inside the chimney; also some runners. Big cams can be used on this pitch but not crucial.   P2 - Take doubles of #3. A #4 can also be used here but you can get by without it in case you opt to leave the big cams on the ledge above p3 for later pickup.   P3 - the only pitch I thought it would be nice to have triples of hand sizes cams 2's & 3's but you can bump them along to save weight. Big cams can be used on this pitch if you brought them along.   P4 - The purple C3 was only used at the start of p4 before reaching the finger crack and it's probably fine to go without it. No big cams #4 or #5 needed. Extend pieces before and after traverse.   P5 - Can use a green or red C3 right off the belay (however the red was very tight, shifted, and we almost lost it.) Two fixed pins in chimney off belay protect the opening moves. I placed triples of 0.5 on p5 since we had an extra along in case we would try the Alien Roof, but 2 will suffice.   P6 - Single 4 & 5 are adequate. The OW size is such that you can bump the 5 the entire way and can leave the 4 behind you as pro (deeper in the crack) anywhere it fits, and there are plenty of options deep in the crack along the way. Take a single set of cams in addition to the #4 and #5 and all the runners. Bring doubles of 0.3; a 0.3 protects the first crux move over the bulge/narrower section (my left knee did not fit here) where you can no longer stem against the right wall. Left side in seems like the way to go after the first crux bulge which you can use face holds to pull past. If you place your only red C3 right off the belay, you may want to back clean it to use it up higher to protect around the OW; there are lots of options for small gear on the lower section of the OW. This is the pitch that requires the most runners. There is a fixed pin about 10 feet above and right of the belay with a long runner on it to protect the traverse. There is a bolt left of the wide crack, which does a good job of keeping the rope out of your way if you clip it short.   P7 - Can use a #4 (or #5 even) to protect the brief wide section before underclinging the giant block.   P8 - A 0.5 or 0.75 in a horizontal shelf left of the entry of the wide crack can protect the entry moves into it. A #4 also works to protect the entry moves and you can bump it up afterward. No need to backclean your big cams. You can leave them in the crack by placing a 0.4 Camalot sized cam in a horizontal crack on the left wall at the very top of the pitch after the climbing is essentially over. This will keep the rope running straight down the pitch, preventing it from pulling your cams into the deep crack. Also, there is a spot to place a small cam (purple C3 to about 0.3 C4 works) inverted about 3/4 of the way up the pitch behind a small edge out right that also keeps the rope from dragging your big cams into the crack (good to put a runner on it).

First time, it was a “climbing ranger” who was kind enough to pull her rope aside after she got through the crux and let us pass through.  I recall being frustrated at having to wait for an extended period of time, but at least this party was somewhat considerate and let us pass.    Yesterday was a different story.  2 parties decided to cut in by the time we reached the top of pitch 3.  First party, I was able to see hang all over pitch 5.  Also, they were carrying huge packs, for essentially a 5 pitch route, I’m sure that was fun on the upper pitches.  Second party to cut in, proceeded to hang all over pitch 4, while we sat and waited on the ledge for 45 minutes.  Maybe warming up on the Crux pitch of the Rostrum wasn’t the best introduction to Yosemite guys.  Long story short, we bailed.   Moral of the story is, if you’re going to elect to cut in on the Rostrum, I think you should at least be dialed in on the route, and not add to the cluster that occurs on this super classic route.  You fully cost my partner the experience of on-sighting this route.

Laybacks, splitter fingers, steep hands, OW, a chimney, and cruiser hand cracks from tight #1s to big #3s in corners of opposite orientations.  Every pitch is an absolute blast!  If you regularly climb in the Creek, the pitch four fingers crux will be the easiest stretch of rock on the route for you.     A tagline and small haulbag were a great asset on this route.  You can leave your big cams in there for the majority of the route (though there are places to dump the #5 early on p1-p3) and let everyone climb unencumbered.  The only time we encountered issues with hauling was on the last pitch, but this could be avoided by hauling from directly above the p7 belay instead of where you finish the route yourself (we went right).     If you opt to traverse right for the final pitch, consider bringing your big cams all the way to the summit with you as well as extending your anchor.  I saw a #5 that tumbled down the crack (bring your fishing rod, booty hunters) and wondered how it got there.  My question was answered when my own wide piece got pushed around by the rope and nearly suffered the same fate.     The first rappel into the route is no longer on a tree, but instead from two bolts at eye-level.  If you have a 60m rope, do a short rappel to start with (giving you 4 raps total).  I thought there were only three rappels, so I rappelled to my knots and stopped just close enough to clip the anchor but too far away to easily transition off the rope.    I stopped earlier on p1 than listed on the Sloan topo and described here.  It felt like a better stance and provided more protection when getting into the 11a thin finger crack on p2.  I back-cleaned the first few pieces I placed in the finger crack to better protect my follower and ease on the rope drag.

About 12 ft off the belay, the leader called down their disappointment: ""This is one of Yosemite's best finger cracks? Not pure, overhyped, so many locker bottlenecks for the fingers, so many footholds outside of the crack. Maybe Squamish .10+..."" Etc etc etc. But! then they moved up past that stance, and it got quieter, the breathing got heavier and the knees shakier, and the rest of the lead was dogged into oblivion (similar to what my onsight attempt looked like a few seasons before).

Crux is thin face climbing to the right of bolts. Second half of pitch is protected primarily by fixed pins and a very old bolt.  P2: a good bolt protects the initial moves into a thin arching crack with some fixed gear. The crack ends as you move on to tricky face moves that felt like solid 5.10. A bit runout here.  P3: Fun 5.10a corner to cruiser 5.8 corner.  P4: This pitch is short and basically moves the belay up and left to facilitate   access to the next pitch. Look for old slings to mark the belay.  P5: Great exposed 5.10a move to juggy 5.8 crack. Ends at a comfy ledge.  Crack selection is not an issue here; that is more of an issue higher up.  P6: The crux. Slippery, steep and exposed. With a few fixed pieces and a bunch of small cams and wires this protects well. Link this pitch with the next pitch in the Reid guide. 70 meter rope mandatory.  P7: This pitch, at 5.11c, is rated the same as the previous pitch but felt much easier. Short and powerful, punch through to good jams on overhanging rock. Mantle on to a ledge with five old bolts as an anchor.  P8: Wild traverse right on good holds with somewhat sporadic pro. Be sure to protect your follower on the downclimbing section. Bring the bigger cams on this pitch. We used both a #4 friend as well as a #4 camalot.  P9: The routefinding crux for us. Traverse on thin 5.10 face right. Pass an off-route crack, go further right to a 5.8 crack that passes through a 5.10a roof. When in doubt on the traverse go further right than you would think.  P10: 5.10b moves to start lead to a super fun crack/face jug haul.  P11: Hyper-exposed 5.7 angling traverse on a huge block leads to an inobvious 5.8 crux. Fairly short pitch. Belay low enough to start the next pitch on a featured face traverse.  P12: Traverse easily (5.6) to a fist crack. Up this thuggishly utilizing face holds to a very large ledge.  P13: Clean hand to finger crack (5.10d) leads to a thin (5.10c) face traverse protected by a funky, but seemingly solid, pin. Continue up the corner all the way to Thanksgiving ledge. This is a linked pitch. Be sure to use long slings down low or ropedrag can be a real problem. 70 meter rope is mandatory to link.  P14 and beyond: Move belay to the far left end of the ledge. Climb up a 5.6 corner. The pitches above get progressively easier until you are fourth classing it to the top.  We fixed pitches 1 and 2 and found that a 70m rope reaches the deck from the second belay. Also, be sure to bring a lot of thin gear (black aliens, 00 tcu). They won't go unused.

In the spirit of Yosemite tradition and a tip of the hat to the original badasses who blazed the way, I'll add my checkmark to ""11d."" ;-)   Edit to add: I just got off the phone with Ron Kauk, and also corresponded over email with Ray Jardine, and it's been helpful to clear up some facts about this route. The first (Ron) and second (Ray) ascents occurred in 1977 (so the ""1978"" listing above should be corrected). Ray also sent me a link to his Climbing Log, which he said he updated daily during his career, so the dates in it are generally quite accurate:  rayjardine.com/Avocations/C… (Thanks to these guys for taking the time to share the info!)

Ray Jardine has long been credited with the first ascent. According to a Climbing magazine article, he worked on the route with hangs, making several hangdog ascents. Then, he redpointed the route, thus making the first ascent & first free ascent. Traditionally yo-yoing was considered the valid style of attempting hard free climbs. If you fell you lowered off to the start of the pitch. Then re-climbed the route, leaving the rope in place, thus top roping back to the high point. A successful yo-yo ascent, like a redpoint ascent, meant climbing from the ground (or belay stance) to the top of the lead without weighting the rope. Difference is with redpointing you don't leave the rope in place. You pull the rope down thus re leading the climb..    To respond to Jon Roderick's comment: yo-yoing is not aid, hangdogging is aid. Jardine employed the tactic of hangdogging, but finally sent climbs redpoint. My understanding is that Jardine considered the redpoint ascent to be leading the climb without weighting the rope & placing all the pro on the free ascent.   He was controversial in the 1970s for employing euro-style tactics. He was often slandered in California. So I have regard the first ascent info on the post as slander or misinformation .

I belayed my partner, and then watched two other people climb the route over about two hours.  Everyone was getting to the crux, falling, and then working out the crux.  We all chatted and exchanged bata.   The next try would be a redpoint attempt for all.  The entire time they were climbing I was watching their beta and planning how I would do the route.  I had never done a 5.12 on my first try before.     Without saying anything to my belayer, I pulled onto the wall.  I climbed through the lower sections multitude of pockets swiftly, using the path employed by the other climbers.  Suddenly I was at the crux.  I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.      At that moment everyone at the base of the cliff took notice and went silent.  I launched into the crux and I remember cheering from below, but they sounded very far away.  Barely hanging in there on the sidepulls and back and forth foot switches, I eyed the finishing ledge.  It seemed really far away.  My gas tank was empty and my forearms were at red line.  In a last ditch effort, I shifted my hips and launched for it with all I had.  I brushed the juggy ledge with my fingertips, no other appendages on the wall.  I hung there in space for what seemed like forever, then I was suddenly speeding towards earth.  I thought This should not be happening!  The next thing I knew I was on the end of the rope a long ways down.  I was told later that I was wind milling my arms and screamed, but I do not remember that.  My belayer said he had given me an extra loop of slack because he was sure I would stick it.

I don't think it would get much attention if it was listed as a mixed route because we have so many incredible routes at the Red. I regret soloing the start. Something feels a little icky around the hype of this route and the non-chalant way the 30 foot free solo is discussed. Despite what people may say it requires commiting (5.7/5.8) moves 30 feet up. It is not just a scramble. Because of the start it is a 2 star sport climb and a 3 star mixed climb in my humble opinion. I know many people love the thrill of the start and there is nothing wrong with that. I just think transparency about the risks involved is important and it's my personal opinion that it doesn't make this route better but instead worse. I've always looked up to this route so I don't say any of this without a lot of fore thought and understanding for people who feel differently.

I belayed my partner, and then watched two other people climb the route over about two hours.  Everyone was getting to the crux, falling, and then working out the crux.  We all chatted and exchanged bata.   The next try would be a redpoint attempt for all.  The entire time they were climbing I was watching their beta and planning how I would do the route.  I had never done a 5.12 on my first try before.     Without saying anything to my belayer, I pulled onto the wall.  I climbed through the lower sections multitude of pockets swiftly, using the path employed by the other climbers.  Suddenly I was at the crux.  I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.      At that moment everyone at the base of the cliff took notice and went silent.  I launched into the crux and I remember cheering from below, but they sounded very far away.  Barely hanging in there on the sidepulls and back and forth foot switches, I eyed the finishing ledge.  It seemed really far away.  My gas tank was empty and my forearms were at red line.  In a last ditch effort, I shifted my hips and launched for it with all I had.  I brushed the juggy ledge with my fingertips, no other appendages on the wall.  I hung there in space for what seemed like forever, then I was suddenly speeding towards earth.  I thought This should not be happening!  The next thing I knew I was on the end of the rope a long ways down.  I was told later that I was wind milling my arms and screamed, but I do not remember that.  My belayer said he had given me an extra loop of slack because he was sure I would stick it.
