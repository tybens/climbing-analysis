I don't think it would get much attention if it was listed as a mixed route because we have so many incredible routes at the Red. I regret soloing the start. Something feels a little icky around the hype of this route and the non-chalant way the 30 foot free solo is discussed. Despite what people may say it requires commiting (5.7/5.8) moves 30 feet up. It is not just a scramble. Because of the start it is a 2 star sport climb and a 3 star mixed climb in my humble opinion. I know many people love the thrill of the start and there is nothing wrong with that. I just think transparency about the risks involved is important and it's my personal opinion that it doesn't make this route better but instead worse.

If you have a second who is capable of following the route, this is also a good option.

There is a great photo of this climb in John Bronaughs second edition guidebook.  This was one of the top routes I wanted to do on that particular roadtrip.     I belayed my partner, and then watched two other people climb the route over about two hours.  Everyone was getting to the crux, falling, and then working out the crux.  We all chatted and exchanged bata.   The next try would be a redpoint attempt for all.  The entire time they were climbing I was watching their beta and planning how I would do the route.  I had never done a 5.12 on my first try before.     Without saying anything to my belayer, I pulled onto the wall.  I climbed through the lower sections multitude of pockets swiftly, using the path employed by the other climbers.  Suddenly I was at the crux.  I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.      At that moment everyone at the base of the cliff took notice and went silent.  I launched into the crux and I remember cheering from below, but they sounded very far away.  Barely hanging in there on the sidepulls and back and forth foot switches, I eyed the finishing ledge.  It seemed really far away.  My gas tank was empty and my forearms were at red line.  In a last ditch effort, I shifted my hips and launched for it with all I had.  I brushed the juggy ledge with my fingertips, no other appendages on the wall.  I hung there in space for what seemed like forever, then I was suddenly speeding towards earth.  I thought This should not be happening!  The next thing I knew I was on the end of the rope a long ways down.  I was told later that I was wind milling my arms and screamed, but I do not remember that.  My belayer said he had given me an extra loop of slack because he was sure I would stick it.  All went on to redpoint next try I believe.  ","Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania",105891685,5.12b,advanced

I clipped the crux bolt low, from an undercling pocket by my feet, rather than from higher on taxing crimps like the others had done.

curt-macneill,Curt MacNeill,"Great route. Agreed with the 4 star status in the guidbook. Super good, maybe not quite as good as some of the 5 star classics in other areas of the Gorge. Very juggy and positive holds for the first half give you a little bit of a punp, then the route abrubtly shifts to smaller holds and longer pulls. Overall, a great route and one of the classics of the Gallery for sure.....  ","Boulder, CO",106895798,5.12c,advanced

jacob-ward,Jacob Ward,There's now two permadraws at the last two bolts which makes hanging the draws a breeze.  ,"Louisville, KY",106895798,5.12c,advanced

There is a reason this is the most viewed route on the Red River Climbing website. It is hyper classic status. Brilliant and powerful opening moves leads to a decent shake, then some easier but fun fluff climbing through the middle to a very cool pocket sequence near the top. From the pocket redpoint crux, slam a jug and finish on hero holds climbing to the top. Worth a trip from anywhere in the world just to do this climb.....   ","Boulder, CO",106333601,5.12d,advanced
dylan-randall,Dylan Randall,"Really, this climb is something incredible. Everything about it screams ""perfect"". Slightly overhanging orange pocketed face crux at the top is immaculate. Get on this climb.  ","Nashville, TN",106333601,5.12d,advanced
brie-abram,Brie Abram,"This route is incredible. If this grade is hard for you, as it is for me, do not fear---there are no stopper moves anywhere on this thing. Getting past the second bolt has one somewhat powerful V3-4 move to a jug, and it was the hardest move on the route for me. I felt the ""crux"" pockets up top are also V3-4-ish.

The moves between all the other bolts are easier sequences that are very reasonable, and most bolts have rest jugs to clip from. So if you can flash V3, and if you can rest on overhanging jugs, give it a shot.  ","Celo, NC",106333601,5.12d,advanced

cris-garcia,Cris Garcia,Soft or not this one was fun! If you can recover on jugs this one’s for you! None of the moves are too difficult if you’ve got a sequence figured out. A lot of options up there that “work” when your bolt to bolting but if you’re on point you better choose the easiest sequence or get spat off.
