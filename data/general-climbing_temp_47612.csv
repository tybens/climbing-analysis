This dude has been rattling off V16s like it’s me doing a V3 circuit at the gym. I would make the case he is the strongest dude out there right now. Who is stronger?  Daniel Woods?  One of the great strong japanese boulderers?  I can’t think of anyone stronger at this point in time.

the strongest climbers in the world are training and competing. once some of them hang that up and get outside more, like drew is doing now, we are going to see some crazy shit go down. Drew dropped out of comp climbing after a poor showing in 2019. Obviously he is all time and a beast, but the strongest climbers in the world are all competing

Depends on what we would collectively consider the strongest. There are certainly climbers that have done more V17 boulders if that is the benchmark of "strongest".  But Drew is certainly building one of the most impressive bases of 14s, 15s, and 16s while also studying for an engineering degree. I'm sure that once that base-building work pays off we will see some even more impressive sends from him, he is certainly already more than capable of the grade, just a matter of time.

I was not trying to suggest that either of them were the strongest.Bosi is one of 2 (?) people who have sent multiple V17s (Alphane and Burden of Dreams), so it feels like he should be in the top tier of your list. Similarly, Aidan Roberts has sent V17, and Fultz hasn't (big fanboy since we live 30 minutes apart), so Aiden should be there. I also think that Bosi considers himself a sport climber, which is interesting.

My instinct says no way he is above DWoods, JWebb or Shawn Rabatou but then I got bored and work a found out he’s done more V16’s than any of them. The interesting thing is, as others have mentioned, is that he has more volume than some other climbers but no V17’s. It‘s really hard for me to determine an absolute best. Think about this, for example, if Shawn Raboutou‘s goal was to pursue climbing as many V15’s and V16’s as he could, instead of projecting Alphane or Megatron, then it seems pretty likely he would have a similar “résumé” as Drew.

That was my only reasoning for excluding him. I’m not aware of him doing many other notable V16’s (aside from downgrading Aiden’s “Isles of Wonder” lol) but I also don’t follow climbing as much as I used to. Similarly, Aidan Roberts has sent V17Again, I am unaware of his climbing accomplishments aside from Alphane to be completely honest. Hence why I also left him off my list. I also left off Nalle due to the lack of V16’s compared to the others in my top tier. Not necessarily disagreeing with you that he should be on the top tier, but I am not going to put him up there with the other names when I can’t name a single notable climb he’s done aside from Alphane.   Fultz hasn't (big fanboy since we live 30 minutes apart)Pretty sure Fultz has done at least six V16’s, which is more than Jimmy Webb…Dwoods has 8 and Drew 10, for perspective. So by this logic, if Matt Fultz can’t be in my top tier then neither can Drew due to lack of V17 ticks. Which I agree with. With that said, if either tick a V17 they are instantly in the top tier for me.

Drew is getting some sort of engineering degree at school of mines, which is one of the more prestigious engineering colleges out there. This is one reason why he has such volume in the V14-V16 range. He can’t travel and spend time traveling to try V17’s. A little surprised he hasn’t done Megatron though considering the proximity. The next closest V17 is what, ROTSW? I guess he technically does have the liberty to focus more on outdoor rock though without the burden of competition training

Now, I realize this is not quite what you said regarding building a ticklist based on volume, but one could also argue that a single 5.15c is "worth" the equivalent as multiple 5.15b's and 5.15a. In other words, what is a "better" or more impressive ticklist; one that contains fifteen V15's and no V16's or one that contains five V15's and five V16's? Both ticklists present valid arguments. I think the far bigger factor is the availability to climb and train much more than someone with a typical job....and genetics.

Obviously it's really hard to compare top level climbers without seeing them on the same climbs, so perhaps this will age poorly, but when I see Drew climb I don't see the "strongest" climber. I see a very good climber, with good pacing and endurance and incredible body strength, who is especially good at heel hooking and drag/chisel. To my eye, at least, he clearly is worse at crimping than either Aidan or Will. You just don't tend to see Drew dominate small holds in isolating positions the same way as those two. Aidan’s so incredible in his style that I think he has actually changed how many people think about climbing. That said, he does seem relatively "bad" at snatchy moves. It'll be interesting to see how/if he approaches Burden of Dreams in the future.Will is relatively weaker than Aidan, especially in the shoulders, but he is much faster, has better balance across grip types, and is far bendier. He reminds me a bit of Ondra, honestly, with more finger strength but less climbing IQ. In terms of accomplishments, he's sent Alphane, Burden, and Honey Badger, and casually flashed Vecchio without a warmup. The latter might not be cutting edge but like… come on.Anyways, it's fun to BS about this. Obviously Drew is incredible and his accomplishments speak for themselves. But I think all of the top people have weaknesses that would come out in a head-to-head comparison with other top people in certain styles. It'll be super, duper, ridiculously interesting to see Will and Aidan stateside in the next few years. (I think Aidan's making an extended Colorado visit next year?)

Nobody clamoring to downgrade Necessary Evil...Similarly, nobody downgrading Jade after Ashina or Katie did it.I think the trend of downgrading after female ascents was a real problem in an earlier, rather toxic period in American climbing. But in the hangover from that people are maybe a bit over-sensitive to it. It definitely still occurs, but mostly from internet trolls, rather than the real players in hard climbing. The way the internet trolls are out for blood on downgrades is somewhat tiresome, so male or female ascents. See also Alphane. In the case of Brooke on Box Therapy, it seems like a well considered and respectful grade suggestion. There needs to be the ability for a climber to suggest a grade revision (up or down) without the peanut gallery losing its mind.

I'm genuinely curious about how other climbers consider the noises we bring to the outdoors, and whether anyone has sincerely considered the ethics of noise. I don't expect any more concensus on this topic than on crag dogs. However, some questions I hope folks would weigh in on:Is there a point at which climber noise rises to an unacceptable level? Can we roughly define that threshold? Do factors such as style of climbing, land management status (e.g. wilderness vs. private), number of parties figure into your calculus?To the veteran climbers out there: Have you observed a cultural shift around noise?Does a loud cohort at the crag present safety concerns that might not be obvious to those transitioning from plastic?Do we have experts who can weigh in on effects of climbing-related noise on wildlife?Is there a minimum grade at which it's acceptable to scream bloody murder?Are there benefits (aesthetic or otherwise) to a noisy crag that might be lost on curmudgeons like myself?

Anecdotal, N=1 observations from POV me after ~30 years of climbing:-the noisiest contingent seems to consistently be psyched younger folks enjoying their newfound sense of freedom in the vertical world, including (but not limited to) forms of self-expression that feel really new and unique to this life phase: radio/tape deck/CD player/Bluetooth speaker/tinny phone, depending on the era.  In the same way that one's personal first teenage romance drama feels like a unique historic event, folks in this phase don't really consider their effect on other climbers, wildlife, neighbors, potential access etc. as a potential negative as the all-conquering righteousness of their exuberance overwhelms any sense of consideration.  See also: tutus, lycra, Halloween costumes, giant posses, CC block break at Indian Creek.  This is distinct from try-hard sounds, as below: - I can't recall the name of the crag, but it's a sport area atop Linville Gorge and was closed to climbing, as pithily related to me by to Ron Dawson, because nearby residents "got tired of hearing people yelling 'fuck!'- Is there a cultural shift? Doubt it.  Some people are self-centered, and some of these are loud.  I think it's been ever thus.  Perhaps the OP is now entering the phase of objecting to the noise, rather than causing or appreciating it.  - Folks running around Hueco blasting Bad Religion or whatever definitely did not endear climbers to the Texas State park rangers BITD, and look what happened to that place.- I can't think of a strong upside to climbers yelling all the time, but I don't really climb in griz territory either

One small way to help this issue is to reinforce better behavior through pranks. If anyone at the crag yells down: “HEY, Am I leaving is this up?!?!”I just give a “hell ya! Thanks!” Regardless if I know them or not and I invite you all to as well.Saves the whole crag from this exchange:Belayer- “Uhhh, idk lemme check. Ayo Jimmy. Jimmy! Hey Jimmy!!!”Jimmy- “wat?”Belayer- “You doing this one?!?”Jimmy- “uhhh was is fun?”Belayer- “maybe. HEY GREG, was it fun!?!?”Greg- “ya it had a handjam!!”Jimmy- “oh I can’t jam”Belayer- “you can’t jam?!?”Greg - “it’s not hard!!”Jimmy- “how hard was the jammy bit??”Greg- “5.8 tops!”Jimmy- “nah take it down”Greg- “did he say take it down?!?”Belayer- “ya!!”Greg- “okay ive never cleaned before but OfF BeLaY!!!”

I tend to avoid anywhere with noise, to the point that I have to make some noise as I walk to avoid being eaten. I've climbed with at least one person who matter of factly and flatly stated that he would destroy any Bluetooth speaker he came across. I believe him. I think the acceptable level of noise at any single spot has a lot to do with the spot and the culture around it. There simply is no one size fits all rule.

Definitely safety concerns if you can't hear your partner over the sound of speakers blasting. There's also the safety concern of simply being less aware of your surrounding environment. Opps couldn't hear that rattle snake that just bit me because I had to have my tunes playing. Personally I also don't like it at all. I get outside to be with nature and I climb for similar reasons. It is wild to me that there are people who want to bring a giant speaker with them outside. This is true for climbing, hiking, whatever. If you want to listen to something while you're in outside then for me its an earbud in one ear and nothing else. Quite for everyone else and you retain situational awareness at least a bit.Mainly if there is a busy crag I just avoid it anyway since regardless of any other factors, as apogee says more humans more noise.

Overly exaggerated try hard noises are the worst, they don't make you look or sound like Chris Sharma and Adam Ondra, most everyone is wondering why you're screaming at the top of your lungs on xyz route. Don't get me wrong,  some amount of grunting is a part of trying hard,  but being the loudest monkey doesn't make you the Alpha. Also screaming fuck at the top of your lungs so everyone will look at you just makes you sound like you're a toddler with a temper tantrum.

However, some questions I hope folks would weigh in on:Is there a point at which climber noise rises to an unacceptable level? Yes, incessant screaming, whether that's beta, or nonsense, is a bit much.  Bluetooth speakers I want to smash into little bits every time I encounter one.  Less so when bouldering as long as it isn't ska or some auto-tuned bullshit.Can we roughly define that threshold? No.  People can't even agree that getting bitten by a fucking dog is the owner's fault when the dog is off-leash and in a public area.Do factors such as style of climbing, land management status (e.g. wilderness vs. private), number of parties figure into your calculus?Yes.  Larger groups and less experienced groups are going to make more noise.  As a matter of fact, larger groups are almost always less experienced, because once you're experienced, you realize in multi-pitching, 2 is the magic number, and with cragging, three to a group tops.  This is just climbing economy of time.To the veteran climbers out there: Have you observed a cultural shift around noise?Yep. Started climbing in '09 and never saw a bluetooth speaker.  Once Honnold appeared on 60 minutes, every prick that's ever tried on a harness thinks that every crag is his own personal playlist concert hall.Does a loud cohort at the crag present safety concerns that might not be obvious to those transitioning from plastic?Maybe?  I don't really think it's a safety concern 95% of the time.  I think it's an entitlement issue.Do we have experts who can weigh in on effects of climbing-related noise on wildlife?You don't need experts.  Studies have been done and that information is available to anyone with a modicum of knowledge on how to get effective Google search results.Is there a minimum grade at which it's acceptable to scream bloody murder?No.  I know people that utter involuntary screams when they're at their absolute limit.  Everyone has different physical limits.  Try hard noises I don't mind.  Think of the tennis player Monica Seles.  I don't even mind joking and banter.  What I do mind is unnecessary screaming or chaos accompanied with incessantly barking dogs and shitty music coming from a tinny-sounding piece of shit bluetooth speaker.Are there benefits (aesthetic or otherwise) to a noisy crag that might be lost on curmudgeons like myself?If you're there to socialize, not to climb, and you're just waiting for your turn to hang on a top rope for 28 minutes straight while making a total of 3 hard moves, then yes, there's a ton of benefit.  If not, then no.

I'm a relatively new climber outside, so take what I say with a Grain of salt.Is there a point at which climber noise rises to an unacceptable level? Can we roughly define that threshold? I think it is more about how sustained that noise is. I think occasional yelling / screaming is fine - whether it is for communication (off-belay) or just a reaction to getting past something that was really challenging. Music, however, just keeps going...Does a loud cohort at the crag present safety concerns that might not be obvious to those transitioning from plastic?Pop-blasting gyms are already louder than every outdoor crag I've seen, so most of their transition is already complete in that regard - though I'd argue that the louder it is, the harder it is to hear someone yell "ROCK!".

This is a side to the noise debate that I’ve never heard get mentioned, but setting routes ground up with a hammer vs on top down with a power drill. I set a route on granite in our area on the opening weekend of hunting season (not in purpose just happened), so there were a bunch of people below us in the surrounding meadows. We were well above them elevation wise. We set this route ground up, with a hammer. It took about 9 hours to drill 6 bolts. Takes forever because you’re run out above the bolt and really don’t want to fall and are super balancey with no hands and it’s not like you can take full or even a quarter swing with the hammer in a position like that. It was hours and hours of “tink tink tink tink tink tink tink tink” echoing for miles around the valley. I can’t imagine how annoying that was for everyone in the area. And probably scaring away the deer too I’m not sure I’m not a deer scientist. So anyways, not trying to start a different debate here, but the noise pollution is definitely a factor in my view on ground up hand drilling vs top down with a power drill.

I figure we have the same percentage of bros broing, but the crags are undoubtedly more crowded than, say, 15 years ago.  So you're more likely to run into a loud bro at a previously quiet crag.  And the only way to hear your own noises is to make them louder than everybody else's -- so crowded crags have gotten louder as crowds increase.

I was once at a crag where a girl was screaming so  loud and continually it sounded like she was giving birth. Everyone at the crag (most including myself were out of view) stopped and just looked at each other “like wtf is going on?”When it finally stopped someone yelled out “it’s a boy!”Then it started again she was top roping a popular route, and it lasted for over 20 minutes.More and more the try hard screams seem to annoy me, even more are the tantrums afterwards. I little Passat is ok, I get it, but it seems to be getting way over the top on a lot of areas.I tend to just walk a bit farther to find some peace and quiet. Climbers don’t like walking, at least most of the ones that scream and carry speakers.

I’ll go hours out of the way to avoid noise, and then prefer minimal communication, preferably via twitches in the rope. Chatter and banter in the approach for sure to keep the pace right, but once the harness goes on its time to shut up and listen. Music is for the car in which case the louder the better.

I climb at a crag that's widely regarded as the training crag., so you'll hear all sorts of noise, from verbal commands to panicked yelling to the dude(tte) at the top who doesn't know how to clean but didn't tell anyone.Unless it's really disruptive I'm okay with some noise since people are having fun. If I wanted to climb here alone I'd come on a weekday.I draw the line at radios and speakers though, ugh.Edit: actually, if there's so much noise that I can't make out what is being said at the anchor, then that's a no-go for me.

I was at a crag last weekend with my partner and there was a party of 4 that we didn't know, plus an unrelated party of 2.  I'm at the anchor of a climb a couple routes over and I have visibility down at the rest of the routes. A woman in the party of 4 was leading a 5.7 that was quite obviously above her paygrade. No disrespect on that point. However, she was clearly panicked and found herself on a ledge having a semi freak out moment, calling down to her belaying nonstop asking where to go or what she should do because she felt she couldn't make the moves to the anchor.  As a side note, it was clear from other conversations I overhead that she'd never taken a fall on gear, so telling her to lower off her last piece was apparently not an option even though I know the route and her last piece should have been a #2 so....realistically should be no issue to lower off. A guy on the route next to her calls out, "hey, are you in a safe stance on that ledge?". She replies that yes she is. He goes, "Ok good, I need you to shut up and be quiet. I can help you, but I need you to be quiet so I can focus right now and then I can help you". It wasn't overly rude, just very firm and direct. She goes silent. He finishes the crux and then gives her instructions. I lived vicariously through that dude because I have been in way too many situations where some guy/gal is yapping non-effing-stop, disrupting the focus of everybody around them or making it so that other climbers/belayers can't hear each other and I hesitated to ask that they lower the volume or just stfu completely.I can appreciate being scared and getting extra chatty, I've been there before although I just get pretty silent. But yeah, there is no reason that other climbers shouldn't be able to communicate with their belayers on a sub-100 ft. tall crag because a couple people are talking at an absurdly loud volume, constantly. So my question to add to the discussion is, what are the ethics around telling somebody to be quiet? When do you deem it appropriate and necessary and what's your approach in terms of language you use?

Unless you literally own the land you are climbing on, whoever manages that land has the say so for whatever arbitrary rules they choose to come up with.Even if it's your own land, there's limits. Neighbors can object.Okay, for myself?It's not climbers actually climbing (or belaying) who are overly noisy. It's usually people who are just hanging around, waiting to climb, watching, or whatever, who get chatty, or joking, or with music, whatever. Myself included, for talking. Climbers are the priority, so, I have both shushed people around me, as a belayer (HEY!! I can't hear my climber!!), and been shushed in turn. Once, I even asked a couple young climbers dudes to turn their music way down or off. They looked sorta miffed, it wasn't all that loud, really. So I let them know I'm deaf in one ear, with a hearing aid, so everything on that side is just as high volume as if it was right in my face. They looked surprised, the whole tone changed, and they turned it off immediately. Pretty sure we also offered them a lap on our rope, if they wanted, too.I'm a dinky old lady, so it's no problem at all for me to yell at people when needed. Sometimes nicely, sometimes pretty darn firmly, when it really matters. No need for me to be hesitant, I'm so obviously unthreatening, lol! Guys, well yeah, it can be more problematic for dudes, I admit that.Best, HelenOh, and I'm outside to enjoy being outside, so other than a quiet guitar at a campsite, something like that, leave the noise makers at home.

Someone said it earlier, its not a new phenomenon to blast music at a crag. That shit used to just take 8D batteries.Public lands are public and people can make noise all they want despite objections (See: shooters, brappers, pic-nics, general campers, etc). Easiest thing to do is ask the noise makers tactfully if they can keep it down and usually things go well IME.

Have people that have asked people at the crag to turn down a bluetooth speaker actually been met with a ton of resistance? Most of the people I see gritting their teeth at these noisy nancy's sit there and  be bitter, mumbling under their breath at the atrocity, without actually attempting to communicate with the problem people to maybe come to an agreement. Or they just lash out, which is just as rude IMO.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wag-bag-program-squamish-1.6964938The Waste Alleviating Gel (WAG) bag program has been set up by the Squamish Access Society (SAS) in partnership with B.C. Parks, and sponsored by businesses in the climbing industry."There's been an explosion in the usage of our backcountry areas in southwest B.C. and the Sea-to-Sky corridor, and rock climbing is very much a part of that," said Ben Webster, SAS chair. "Increasingly we are finding that there are issues with human waste, particularly in our more remote crags."[Webster] said five stations have already been set up at crags, with four more expected to be ready in the next two weeks, and the stations have already required restocking — something that was expected, as people grab a WAG bag to throw in their pack for whenever it's required.

Can you post some pics of the bite/swelling out of curiosity? Ppl never seem to post pics of the injuries they sustain from crag dogs. Jbtw it's state law some places to put a dog in quarantine if the bite breaks skin for rabies observation. Were they herding you or what? I like dogs at the crag/anywhere but you're right if they are liable to bite people for no apparent reason best they stay home.

It would be a good idea to report to animal control and make sure the dog has been vaccinated against rabies. If they get multiple reports of the same animal biting people they may confiscate the animal. Please seek medical attention. If you are overdue for a tetanus shot, get one. If a bacterial infection has occurred, it needs medication. Dog bites are serious.

I’d recommend getting the rabies shots, especially if you don’t have any info on the dog/owner. Chances are the dog probably doesn’t have rabies, but rabies are 100% fatal, once you start showing symptoms it’s too late, there is nothing they can do for you, and it’s a horrible way to go. I was bit by a dog while out for a run a few months ago. I was not going to get the shot until I started reading into it more. You could get rabies from a bite, have it for a few months not even knowing it, and then once symptoms show it’s too late to get help. Again, the chances are slim but it’s not worth dying over, and the shots will give you peace of mind.I get why you’re posting, it’s frustrating and its bullshit. I got bit while running on a public path, from a dog on a leash. Just lunged at me while I was passing by. The owner swore his dog was good, has never done that before, all that nonsense. It’s bullshit and frustrating when people take their animals into public spaces and then don’t maintain control over them.

I think we've established in past threads that killing or injuring a dog that you belive poses a threat to you, or that bit you on the ankle or something minor like that, would likely result in legal consequences.  In my view, that is as it should be.However, this is completely different.  If a dog or dogs attack a human basically to kill them, as it seems in this case, I don't think a law enforcement officer or court in the country would punish somebody for defending themselves.  In my view, that is also as it should be.  If the owners were minors, their parents should have been held responsible.  If they were young adults with drug problems, dirt bag lifestyles, or whatever, they should have be held responsable.Some of you might be following the "Bully XL story" in the UK.  This has some similarities.  As a general rule, I don't think we can say that certain breeds are more or less aggresive than others.  However, we can definitely say that if certain breeds are aggresive, the consequences can be severe.  Owning these high-risk dogs should come with additional controls and responsabilities.

These dogs can be super smart and affectionate, otherwise well behaved, and still display this biting/nipping behavior. No dog with this behavior should EVER be brought to a crag. The consequences of a dog biting an active belayer can easily be imagined.

I’m telling you bringing chocolate crag cake is the solution. I can think of maybe two good reasons for bringing a dog to a crag, but the reasons for bringing chocolate crag cake to a crag are endless:- I brought it for my birthday- I brought it for your birthday- I brought it to celebrate my send- I brought it to celebrate your send- I couldn’t leave it at home alone, my fridge is broken The list goes on and on.You can make as many friends, if not more, by bringing chocolate crag cake than you could a crag dog.I guarantee my chocolate crag cake won’t wonder over and bite you. In fact, YOU can bite my chocolate crag cake!If your out of control crag dog wanders over and attacks my chocolate crag cake, guess whose leaving the crag early to go to the vet? Not me and my chocolate crag cake buddy. Chocolate crag cake is superior in all ways.

Selective breeding for some truly terrible behavioral attributes, along with the anatomy and musculature for fighting makes for an awful companion animal in a free society where people are allowed to bring their pets into public spaces and comingle with other dogs, kids, etc.It doesn’t matter if 99% of them are sweet and loving and would never hurt a fly. The statistics (maulings and fatalities) are undeniable. They should be outlawed. Let the current generation of existing pits and their owners live their lives happily and then in 15 or so years this madness will come an end, if they are all sterilized.

Sounds like the only additional step the owner could have taken is to muzzle the dog (probably a good idea for any crag dog).that is, of course, your argument is that the dogs should be left at home. My response would be, then the kids should be left at home too. Have you been to Bath rock???This isn't a "crag" in the usual sense of how we imagine that to be. It's an extremely popular spot that's seconds from a parking lot.The climbing is right next to the rock. The main, and most popular, area is the rollercoaster wall, with a bunch of routes in close proximity. The staging area is between the wall itself, and a wood rail fence. Only maybe 10' or so from the rock. It's usually quite full of people, packs, and yes, one to three dogs tied up to the fence. The pups are usually chill. Usually. The other sides of Bath rock are a bit more open (no fence) but the staging is still very tight to the rock.At least the dog was leashed. There's plenty at COR whom persist in thinking the "all dogs must be leashed at all times" somehow doesn't include their pooch. Sad truth is that, if we, as climbers, can't police each other? The simple policy change is no dogs. Period. No park anywhere is exactly overstaffed or overfunded, and rangers wasting vast amounts of time telling people to get their dog leashed?That's just stupid selfish, for climbers (and any others, of course) to do that. The other thing rangers have to do over and over and over?Ticket idiots who park where they shouldn't, usually on dry grass, and patrol campsites for untended fires.I'd far rather have them lessening the wildfire risk, then being stuck with nagging on the leash thing. Best, Helen

Good topic for MP, not quite as fun as the simul-rap debate threads but good enough. Every time this topic comes up, I just remember we have anti-vaxxers out there and suddenly it isn't as unbelievable that there are people in denial of gene expression outside of physical traits. Humans literally selected these traits into the breeds, its the same reason my border collie herds me even though nobody ever taught him the first thing about it - unless he's been watching youtube videos at night about it without my knowledge.https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01379-4Selective breeding of domestic dogs has generated diverse breeds often optimized for performing specialized tasks. Despite the heritability of breed-typical behavioral traits, identification of causal loci has proven challenging due to the complexity of canine population structure. We overcome longstanding difficulties in identifying genetic drivers of canine behavior by developing a framework for understanding relationships between breeds and the behaviors that define them, utilizing genetic data for over 4,000 domestic, semi-feral, and wild canids and behavioral survey data for over 46,000 dogs. We identify ten major canine genetic lineages and their behavioral correlates and show that breed diversification is predominantly driven by non-coding regulatory variation. We determine that lineage-associated genes converge in neurodevelopmental co-expression networks, identifying a sheepdog-associated enrichment for interrelated axon guidance functions. This work presents a scaffold for canine diversification that positions the domestic dog as an unparalleled system for revealing the genetic origins of behavioral diversity.Claiming that certain dog breeds don't have specific behaviors is hilariously incorrect, implying rather that they're purely conditioned. But oddly enough this claim is limited to certain breeds in which empirical data has routinely shown a disproportionate number of fatal attacks on humans, and countless more on other dogs. But what is that in contrast to people who own a pit and anecdotally claim the entire breed to be harmless because theirs has yet to act up?

Misinformation abounds, but some replies are spot on.Some breeds ARE more likely to bite. Studies have been done. The breeds most likely to bite are Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, Beagle, Jack Russell Terrier, Chihauhuas, Dalmatians, Cocker Spaniels.However small dogs don’t do much damage. The dogs most often involved in attacks with serious injuries or deaths are Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Bulldog type breeds (American Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, Boxers) Dobermans, Labradors. Pit bulls are popular with irresponsible owners increasing the number of overall bites per year.If you want to ban Pit Bulls you should want to ban other large powerful breeds (at least Rottweilers and German Shepherds), because that’s what makes them dangerous.Dogs bred for dog fighting were bred to be aggressive to dogs, NOT to be aggressive to humans. If a handler got bit that dog was not bred.All dogs are born with unique temperaments, even from the same litter (just like human siblings can have different personalities). Some dogs are skittish from the get go and some are mellow. How a dog is treated also affects its behavior. A mistreated dog can become a problem, even more so if it was skittish to begin with. So though there may be breeds more likely to bite, but you need to judge the individual dog. There’s plenty of Labradors that have bit people and plenty of Pit Bulls that wouldn’t hurt a fly.2 or more dogs become a pack, often hunting instincts kick in and they’re way dangerous than a single dog. Having 2 or more big dogs off leash in public the sign of an ignorant, selfish dog owner.Any responsible dog owner should be well aware of their dogs temperament and treat it accordingly. A big dog that shows aggression to people shouldn’t be out in public, much less off leash.

I'm reminded once again when I read some of the replies to this thread, how many people have very strong opinions about things they know nothing about, and have misunderstood information they have seen. As a retired molecular biologist, I find the misunderstanding of genetics, breeding and the meaning of breeds particularly amusing. The AKC description of a breed's temperament will give you a very precise idea of what your purebred dog will be like, although there will be variations with individuals.  But then that temperament will be highly molded by training. Training is so important and unfortunately many dog owners have no idea how to do it.Here is a description of a breed I am very familiar with, having had 5 boxers in my family in my lifetime:Boxers are a bright, energetic, and playful breed and tend to be very good with children.[4] They are patient and spirited with children, but also protective, making them a popular choice for families.[4] They are active, strong dogs that require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being "headstrong", which can be related to inappropriate obedience training. Owing to their intelligence and working-breed characteristics, training based on corrections often has limited usefulness. The Boxer by nature is not an aggressive or vicious breed. It is an instinctive guardian and can become very attached to its family. Like all dogs, it requires proper socialization. Boxers are generally patient with smaller dogs and puppies, but difficulties with larger adult dogs, especially those of the same sex, may occur. Boxers are generally more comfortable with companionship, in either human or canine form. They are very patient and are great to adopt as family dogs because they are good with children and people of all kinds.This description is 100% accurate. Our boxers were all, without exception, extremely affectionate and loving with all family members and people they had been introduced to as friends.  They were especially good with the babies and small children and would sit and gaze at the adult humans beseechingly when the toddlers were sitting on them and pulling at their faces and ears.However, boxers are extremely protective of their family.  Strangers to the house or territory, the environment they were guarding, would be met with great ferocity. It took careful "introductions" of new people as "friend" before they would stand down from their desire to attack. Outside the house, my boxers were always leashed.  If no one was nearby they would explore within an allowed range of the leash, but at the command "time to work" they would fall into heel position and do as instructed. If unleashed they were trained to "stay" and "come" and "sit" by voice command, so they would never run up to strange people or animals.  Almost never - squirrels were going to be chased into the nearest tree no matter what. When out walking with my boxers I would always cross to the other side of the street or go out into the road when another person or dog was passing, so that person was not entering my personal space.I would never in a million years have taken my boxers with me to a social engagement, a crowded environment of strangers, and particularly a climbing crag, where other people-strangers and dog-strangers would be coming and going. Even though they were all very well trained. It's generally not the right breed for those environments.  I have "met" a few boxers out and about that have been trained to accept all strangers as "friend" but that is unusual. Our's were always trained to be guard dogs.I'm not sure how any owner of a mixed breed dog thinks they understand that dogs temperament and whether it will bite, until they have observed it in a large variety of situations over a significant period of time.I have zero problem in theory with dogs at any crag. I've personally never had any serious problem with any dogs I've encountered there, but I'm careful not to go into people's space until the dog is under control of their human. And I've met plenty of crag dogs who are not well trained and do not respond to voice commands. Fortunately for me, those dogs have not been aggressive. I'm sorry for people who have met poorly trained, poorly controlled dogs, that are also aggressive, guarding, protective, and territorial.

Properly exposing your dog at a young age is the owner’s responsibility, not the dogs.

Nothing you posted, nor have I seen any stats so far, addresses my point; which is that humans are responsible for their dogs behavior and actions. I would venture a guess that a large percentage of the human fatalities by dog came from feral dogs. Providing statistics regarding feral dog attacks vs. dog attacks in the presence of owners would be relevant data I am looking for from you. A dog on a leash or with tremendous recall will likely never cause issue unless approached by the “victim”. The leash and recall training being the human influence negating any inherent tendencies by the dog (herding, pointing, biting according to you, etc.). There is a reason many states (such as Colorado) that charges the owner of the dog for bites/attacks. Humans are the issue, not the dog. God forbid you travel out of this country and encounter regions where the majority of dogs you encounter are 100% feral and you understand the difference between feral dogs and dogs with shitty owners.Either way @john wood nailed it

Properly exposing your dog at a young age is the owner’s responsibility, not the dogs.

The entire dog breed argument seems like a red herring. Why isn't the discussion on the expectation of tethering / physically restraining your dog at the crag? Seems like there's some middle ground here where we could agree that dogs are fine at the crag IF they are leashed or tethered at a distance that restricts them from people outside the owner's party. I'd prefer no dogs at the crag. My wife loves dogs at the crag. When we do bring any of our dogs, we compromise and tether them to a ground anchor. People have to make an active choice to interact with them, and almost always ask permission first. If there's no room to do this, we just don't bring them. To this day, they haven't stolen a single chocolate crag cake!@Mark Pilate - Hilarious! Perfect response!

Pro dog: Bad dogs are a product of bad ownership, thus blame the humanAnti dog: Bad dogs are a product of selective breeding, thus blame the dogEither way, when others are belaying, an unleashed dog is a risk factor. They have reduced mobility and their climber's life on the line. Please don't assume that everyone else is automatically ok with your dog. I was not until my in-laws got a dog. Others in my extended family are deathly afraid.It seems non-sensical to cater the world around someone's fear of a dog, so that's a fair argument, but to that end, a fair compromise would be to keep the dog on a lead while at the crag. It's a win-win, your dog gets to come with you, but is within your direct physical control if need be.On a semi-related note, which is a better crag snack for maintaining energy, a salami stick, or a chocolate cupcake?

However, that’s still not my point and you haven’t really been engaging in conversation this entire time as you continually ignore my point so I’m not sure this will change the dynamics the conversation and/or forum And for the record, I was genuinely curious if you perceive “bloodthirsty” breeds as being overly aggressive for the duration of their life’s or if you only perceive them as being bloodthirsty in specific situations…in which case could have hopefully lead to some healthy talking points regarding prevention of the situations causing attacks. I’m also somewhat perplexed as to how any of that correlates to my treatment of babies. I am an opponent of babies at the crag if that’s what you’re implying.

Todd. I get that you are a vet and that you have clients with pitties but reality really doesn't care about official lines that bad behavior in dogs is always the fault of the owner and never the breed.  I absolutely love Heelers and they rarely break the skin when they nip heels but every one I ever knew did it sooner or later. Show me a border Collie that doesn't naturally herd. Pit bulls have been bred to kill and they have a fabulous record of doing exactly that.  On top of breed there's also personality. Our pets absolutely have it and some of them are just naturally jerks.  I bought a Bengal cat once that was a stone cold killer and a real handful. I bought the book on training it. I got it as a little kitten and tried to be the best influence possible but Beastie was a jerk. I suspect that he was one or two generations too close to the actual wild cat. I don't think he was a straight up first generation hybrid but no way was he the 4 generations removed from the wild cat that is required to be an official Bengal. He had lots of moments of affection and cuddling etc but at least several times a week he would get weird and stalk and attack me full tilt. I would toss him out in his enclosure and when he came in 20 minutes later he was fine and affectionate. Somehow I put up with that situation for 9 years... talk about an abusive relationship. Pet owners are blind.

Pet owners are blind. Nick, i am offended at your implication that my views are based on having clients with pitties. in my 13 years ive euthanized 1 aggressive pitty that despite great owners have been aggressuve to humans as well as 2 great danes a rottweiler, doberman and maybe 4 mixed breeds. i openly cried each time with the owners left with little choice. each pet should be judged individually. also i did say pitties are more prone to aggression. that doesn't mean "all" by default. a lot of the fatal pitty attacks are associated (correlation) with intact and when theres more than one.the oath we take at graduation that i take seriously:"Being admitted to the profession of veterinary medicine, I solemnly swear to use my scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and welfare, the prevention and relief of animal suffering, the conservation of animal resources, the promotion of public health, and the advancement of medical knowledge.I will practice my profession conscientiously, with dignity, and in keeping with the principles of veterinary medical ethics.I accept as a lifelong obligation the continual improvement of my professional knowledge and competence."Temple Grandin says dogs are 4 generations from being wild and cats 4 hours. :)edit: forgot to mentiin, Nick, thanks for doxing me.

What is the owner getting out of this?  They owner interacts with the dog like 8% of the time they are there.  Meanwhile most dogs hate it 100% of the time they are there.  If the dog isn't hating it, it's either a minority well behaved dog, or off leash messing something up. Look at what Burno was putting that dog through.  Look at the picture, he made that dog go climbing with him because he thought she would love just watching him do this stupid thing that she didn't understand.  Which is wild when the other option is for her to stay at home and sleep happily.

And they absoluty handle the dog differently when the client is not watching.  I got that view from hanging  out with folks/ co workers in that profession and seeing how they work.   While I do agree that the owner has a lot to do with it the individual personality of the animal and the breed have to factor in. Thats kind of how life works. A bunch of things add up to the whole.  The bottom line however is that year after year Pitties account for the most fatalities and Rotties are #2  and very often its young children and elderly getting killed.

The solution for those who feel unfairly overrun and abused by free range kids and dogs at the crag, is to fight fire with fire and bring their own.  Then we’re all one big happy family.  No need to go all in on the mess and expense of the real thing though.   Everyone should have a “dog glove” (doglove?) handy — ideally wear it on your brake hand for extra grip — you’ll be the safest belayer out there.   Any pesky kids or dogs get in your shit and you immediately put the fear of god into them with a quick snapping growl.    Then when your climber is safe and off belay (another selling point for going “in direct”), you chase the incompetent “parent or guardian” around the crag “ARrrrARRR-RrRrrrr” and bite the shit out of them till they get the memo and cry uncle

I own a Newfoundland.  His name is Pickles.  I love him and have hiked weekly with him for 8 years. I own some sheep sheers to groom him myself.Honestly if your dog is actually chill at the crag cool I don't mind the dog, but most owners seem to overestimate how the dog does at the crag.  The first time I ever argued with Bruno he told me Luna loves the crag then like a month later he admitted she hated the crag. Again it seems to me and others most owners ignore how much the dog likes the crag or abuses the crag.  If going to the crag is how you create companionship with your dog you're probably doing it wrong.Also I don't really get what you saying about belaying someone projecting above their pay grade and happy crag dogs.  Feels like an excuse to make a gate keeping comment?  I dunno.

@ grug grug if you look at the statistics, I beleive you will find that no breed is more inclined to bite than another.   The damage inflicted by bites, and fatal attacks, that's a different story, as I wrote above.  It's like the liklihood/consequence risk equation.  Dogs with higher consequences require more control.  I support the mandatiory sterilization of these fighting breeds, as well as greater controls on opwnership, and punshments adn penalties for not following guidelines.  But the resources just aren't there for enforcement.@ Jordan...if you've had 6 bad dog encounters in 5 years you're doing something wrong.  Plain and simple.  I love dogs, both my own and other peoples. In 62 years I've only been bitten once. I was just a kid when it happened and I probably deserved it given the way I was treating the dog. But here's the thing, it was a dachshund and the damage was minor. If it had been a bigger dog the consequences for both of us would have been a lot more severe so I second Bruno that dogs with higher consequences require more control. That's not to excuse a poorly behaved small dog but breed does matter when it comes to risk. As to dogs at the crag I think it's fine if it's not crowded, the dog is well socialized and is kept on a leash but I've certainly seen situations where that's not the case.

Typical. Yeah, sorry I read that wrong, my bad.  Good self-deprecating humor.  I don't know if misreading something is "typical" of me if so I'll work on it.  Humor however I'm always down for so keep laying it on.As for naming Pickles wish I could take credit.  When my wife and I brought him home I had all these regal names in mind like King George or Tiberius and my 5 year daughter said he should be named Pickles.  Damn she nailed it. Again, no animosity to dogs, just if you own a dog put some fore thought into your activities with the dog.  Most the time certain hobbies or places should be reconsidered for most dogs. Had a funny run in with a dog owner this morning while waiting at the bus stop with my kids.  This lady came up walking a juvenile/puppy dog and walked right through 15 kids stuffed on a corner waiting for the school bus. While she approached, she started yelling "No one touch him he's still training, stay away he still bites!!!!" Like she had been b-lining it to us for a block and a half to a crowd of kids on a corner who are at this corner every day just to cut through the middle of the crowd.  The other side of the road, the middle of the road, someone else's lawn was all open.  Just a little fore thought was all that was needed.

Dogs at the crag suck. I love dogs, they are great. But if you bring your dog to the crag you are selfishly putting your own desires/convenience first at the cost of negatively impacting others experience. It’s not really any different than bumping tunes on your Bluetooth speaker.there are a bunch of negatives which mainly impact others:They shit everywhere and it’s only sometimes cleaned up.They bite people They steal peoples foodThey barkThey dig up the ground at the base of the cragThey fight each otherThey act aggressive/territorialAnd only a few positives, which are all for you:You get to hang out with your dog yay for youYou don’t have to worry about arranging care for your dog while you are out climbing yay for you“My dog likes it” on the whole its a selfish thing to do if you are going to a crag that you might reasonably expect other people to show up to.It would be one thing if peoples dogs were well trained or they kept them leashed, but they generally aren’t/don’t.

Look, it's really sorta simple.One dog is fine.But are 10,000 dogs?A lot has changed, including populations. It also used to be fine to camp anywhere you pleased, take a dump as needed, on and on. But most of the places climbers go have way more people there.Even if a dog is a total sweetheart, leashed, taken care of, has a person sitting right there with it?They still circle around, scratch around, curl up, and nest. In the same spots, over and over and over. And that leash lets them be a little farther out than the hoomans at the crag, plus, someplace to tie that leash means the pup is often adjacent to vegetation.Not remotely a big deal, it's a very small thing, same as cutting a corner across a lawn, or throwing some pads down around that sweet new boulder you found. No problem.Until it's multiplied.This way of thinking tempers our inclinations to be selfish, or at least helps to widen our thinking beyond our own interests.This thing I'm contemplating, is it sustainable? What happens if everyone does it? Are there impacts to others? What would make it work for everyone?It's not much different, discussing climbing at all, and the myriad of impacts, and our pups. Do what's fair for everyone, and keep our climbing areas viable.Best, Helen

In the same way, what I say here MIGHT make a difference in someone else’s thinking, so to me it’s worth doing.

Well Nowhere, reading.a casual post like your about how a climber's dog just didn't enjoy the crag changed my perspective on bringing my own dog to the crag, so I suppose you/re right.  Perhaps my sarcasm is misplaced.  But it is important to emphasize that with the right people, and the right dog, and the right crag, canines are just fine. That's the part always that always seems missing from the anti-dog rants.

What says the mob?I left my dog away from the crag, off trail in a good spot with my 12 year daughter, who likes to draw while my wife and I climb. My dog is a blue heeler (yes they have a propensity for being protective and nipping), and she is a sensitive rescue dog that "fell off the back of a truck in NM". She is sweet and loving but weary of people. She doesn't bark, and only sleeps at the crag. All of a sudden a younger dude, climber, ran down the hill stomping on the talus. He went off the main trail and towards my dog and daughter. My daughter flinched at the noise and my dog got scared and tried to nip him as he came within 3 feet of my daughter. My dog barely missed getting the back of his pants as he leapt out of the way and she was on a leash. What does the climber own in this conflict? I took my dog away from the trail. I leashed my dog, who was quiet all day. My daughter was with my dog. Who's at fault here?

Another dog came out of nowhere and a dog fight ensued. This happened while the owner was 1/2 up the route so her belayer had to belay and separate the two dogs as best he could.  A minute later a clueless hiker came by looking for her dog.

I remember helping develop a crag in Logan Canyon [Utah] that’s now quite popular, and I remember how beautiful it was when we first discovered it, with grass and wildflowers growing everywhere,” said Doug Heinrich, vice president of product for Black Diamond Equipment and a lifelong climber. “But if you go there today, it’s all bare, compacted earth. Not a blade of grass or flower in sight. That really bummed me out. But the point is, climbers don’t even know what’s been lost when they visit new areas.

If people do that, it's at least minimized. Without that infrastructure, most of our crags would be pretty bleak. At truly popular spots, it's the only viable option for climbing (camping, hiking, biking, etc) to move forward, with ever increasing usage.Dogs, however, expand that impact outside of the infrastructure, even leashed.This is the Rollercoaster wall, on the back side of Bath rock. Probably the most visited climbing in Idaho. The infrastructure there, trails, stairs, staging area with fencing, helps corral the climbers, and there are still bushes and trees in relative proximity to the wall.Just outside the fence? Are all the scoops where pups snooze. This is leashed dogs, almost always totally chill. Unleashed?You're really begging trouble, or an outright ban on dogs at that crag. Everyone on here should be able to grasp that the simplest answer to any problem, for managers of public lands, is "no". Climbers aren't the only culprits in this, of course, but we sure could do a lot to help make our pups a non issue. Besides, there's also the dog's comfort and safety to consider. I've seen lost dogs running along roads, terrified, confused, scared, quite a few times at COR. I've also seen dogs nearly hit by cars, and poor pups who discovered the park has prickly pear cacti.At the very least, keep your pup leashed, have what is needed to take care of them, and someone there who will do so. Beyond that? Do some friendly, gentle, self policing with others in our community. This just shouldn't be a problem.Best, Helen

​Bruno, I appreciate your willingness to cool things down and think about where we find common groundTo be fair I agree with you that some combinations of dog and owner can be totally chill at the crag. It’s just that in my experience they are in the minority, and the negative impacts of a bad dog on everybody else outweigh the neutral impacts of a fine dog on everybody else, so on the whole I am against it.Charlie B wrote:What says the mob?I left my dog away from the crag, off trail in a good spot with my 12 year daughter, who likes to draw while my wife and I climb.

If you know your dog might bite people for behaving in ways that people can be reasonably expected to behave it’s your responsibility to keep that dog out of those situations. For the dogs sake, and for other peoples sake. I would like to respectfully disagree here.  I know you're against bringing dogs to crags Nowhere, but I think your pushing the limits here. There truly has to be some responsability in terms of people's behavior regarding how they approach and interact with dogs.  As I have said before, dogs have been part of human life for thosands of years, and enjoy a unique evolutionary bond with us.  They are part of life--going out in public means interacting with dogs, and taking some care for how you do so.  Yes, there are dogs that nip and lunge or attack unprovoked, but they are the great minority of dogs.  I am willing to bet that the majority of dog bite cases could be avoided if people simply gave dogs a little respect and room, if they modified their behavior just a little bit, the same way that you would accomodate a young child or an elderly person in a public space.  If there is a dog neaby, you can't just push ahead and ignore the dog, refuse to give way out of anger or stubborness or lack of awareness, or invade the dog's space because you think that's your right, and not expect some reaction.  This is what we do in public spaces--we accomodate the public, including other humans and animals, with tolerance and compromise.  Anything less is an extremely entitled viewpoint, as I have argued in the past.  In this case, we're not talking about two pit bulls attacking another dog, or a out of control bully XL.  We're talking about a family dog on a leash lying on a blanket with a young girl.  The climber ran into an area area with no care or respect, and the dog reacted just as one might expect.  This is common sense.  It is completely the climber's fault.  I think the owner took all reasonable precautions, the dog seems to be just fine for a crag dog, and I appluad the owner for bringing his family, dog and child, to the crag.  This is life.

If the guy attacked the girl, nobody would have a problem. "Walking nearby" is not a reason to be bitten. If you want to make the analogy to giving space to people, it's also not a reason to be punched by a person. Running or being loud outdoors does not justify physical violence by person or dog, and if either is incapable of refraining from attacking, they shouldn't be at the crag.

People are mixing "fault" and "responsibility".Even if your pups behavior is entirely the fault of someone/thing else, it is still 100% your responsibility.Same as your children. If your 17.5 year old decides to do something stupid, it may not be your fault. But it's still you who will be held responsible. Heck, if it's money? Maybe even when they're a full adult (student loans), or even your own spouse might leave you liable (responsible) for shit you had no direct part in.And, just like in climbing, there is always the possibility of low probability, high consequence events, with animals, children, spouses....So pick judiciously and make wise decisions about the lot of them, and the risk/reward/nuisance quotient!

Dog and gun owners have a lot in common. Both can bring happiness, both can cause injuries and even deaths. Should a few bad instances ban dogs or guns from use? Does bread or type of gun matter when it is the owner's misuse/training that causes the problems? If you're supportive of both dogs and guns I understand your stance. Likewise if you are for removing guns and dogs from public spaces I understand you.

Bruno it is WILD to me that you are casting the expectation that dogs who are likely to bite strangers be kept away from strangers as “entitled”. It is the dog owners who bring their dogs out and expect others to just know to keep their distance, or guess at what speed they should move at in order to not get bitten who are entitled.  Yes dogs like every single animal including humans have certain behaviors they will perceive as enough of a threat that they will escalate to physical violence.

Bruno it is WILD to me that you are casting the expectation that dogs who are likely to bite strangers be kept away from strangers as “entitled”. It is the dog owners who bring their dogs out and expect others to just know to keep their distance, or guess at what speed they should move at in order to not get bitten who are entitled.  Yes dogs like every single animal including humans have certain behaviors they will perceive as enough of a threat that they will escalate to physical violence.

@ Nowhere--I empathize with your consternation.  As WILD as you find my view (mirroring your use of caps) I find your perspective astonishing.  It's always interesting when two people have such diverghent views, but I guess that's life. @ Leron # 1--so now we have a 12 year old startled brother throwing a rock that causes stitches.  Well, before I answer, I would need to know more information.  I think we could both immagine situations where throwing a rock was warranted, and situations where it was not.  So hard to say.  Same with the dog encounter.@ Leron # 2--the dog-gun comparison is intriguing and has come up in the past.  There are some parallels on an abstract level.  The big difference, I think, is that dog are living things, with their own "soul" so to speak, and should be treated as such.  @ JE and other who like the idea of muzzles...once again my views are very different.  I think muzzles as appropriate in some circumstances such as for dogs that have proven to be aggresive and have a bite that could inflect serious and potentially fatal damage.  But for a "normal" dog with its family, I think is muzzle is a cruel form of torture.  It reflects a very human-centric view of dogs, and fails to honor what our human relationship to dogs represents.  A muzzle is much more than a "paper hat" for a dogs nose.  Putting a muzzle on a dog is similar to tying down a dogs tail--it prevents the dog from interacting with the world in a normal and fulfilling way.  Smelling, sniffing, licking, touching, exploring, kissing.  These are part of a dog's life, and preventing a dog from using its mouth and nose in a normal was is unecessary and cruel, when the alternative, simply modifying our own behavior somewhat, is far more generous and fair.  Last point, to those who say, "just leave the dog at home," some dogs are happy to stay home and sleep, but most dogs are overjoyed when their master/family/pack returns, and most dogs are ridiculosly excited when they get to go on adventures with their owners.  Leaving a dog at home is in many cases a kind of torture or abandonment.  I think part of owning a dog is giving a dog a full life.  And part of that is 1) being with dogs and not leaving them alone, 2) letting dogs explore freely off leash in nature and 3) letting dogs associate and socialze with other dogs and people.  For dogs that enjoy crags, these three aims are fulfilled.  All it takes is for the dog to be moderately well behaved and for people to me moderately tolerant, as we are talking about a public space.  As I have said, my dog doesn't enjoy the crag, so I don't bring her, but enjoy the crag, I certainly would bring her.  Instead, I take her hiking, trail running, mountain biking, and so on, often in the company of other people and dogs.  Nothing she enjoys more than a day out in nature with her pack. Gratuitous picture of a crag dog:

Just like I can wear sunglasses, helmets, gloves, etc all day. Football players also seems to do just fine.That muzzle is fully open and allows the dog to sniff, smell, lick, and probably even chew small toys.Is it torture for a dog to be on a leash? After all, dogs are mad to run around and they can’t do that on a leash. Ridiculous notion

@Bruno you wrote this: I think part of owning a dog is giving a dog a full life.  And part of that is 1) being with dogs and not leaving them alone, 2) letting dogs explore freely off leash in nature and 3) letting dogs associate and socialze with other dogs and people. Which I think is spot on. I do think it’s important to provide those things for your dog, but you should do them in an appropriate venue for the dog that doesn’t detract from other users experience-take your dog to the dog park, on a hike, to the deep backcountry empty crag etc. if you can’t do that and have time to climb, then don’t climb or don’t have a dog, doing otherwise is selfish, putting your needs/desires ahead of others. And to the muzzle thing you are wayyyy off base. I have worked many many 12 hour shifts wearing an n95. It’s a minor inconvenience to have your face covered. If I could wear one that I could eat and drink through and still got the job done it wouldn’t even be that.

I don’t disagree with most your last post, but my point is just that the chill, relaxed (read: well trained dogs) are not the ones who require muzzles, especially within the context of “dogs at the crag”. Ah okay, I see your confusion. I was suggesting that it is good to train even easy going dogs to wear muzzles if the need for them to wear one arises at some point in the future. I was not suggesting that easy going dogs need to wear muzzles to the crag. Edit: As others have noted though, there are good reasons for otherwise easy going dogs to wear muzzles to the crag. Edit 2: Muzzles should not be used for extended periods of time such as an entire climbing outing and are not a replacement for working on reactivity/training with your dog.

 That's a long way of saying that you don't really understand  dog behavior and their social structure.  ANY dog, no matter how well trained or relaxed can become aggressive and bite.  It all depends on the situation they are in and their current mental state.    You’re confusing ability with likelihood. These are two very, very different things. Please reference the 8a thread. I also never once said a dog can’t become reactive and bite. I actually don’t believe I mentioned anything about being aggressive and biting. My only comment was that muzzles, generally speaking and within the context of this thread, are not meant for the “easy going” crag dogs…but rather, the reactive/poorly trained dogs. All in all you entirely missed my point, but at least were trolling in the process. KudosIf we really want to get to the nitty-gritty name calling, it’s you who is showing your ignorance on the subject by using terms like “aggressive” when, in reality, you mean “reactive”. Very few dogs are actually aggressive whereas nearly all dogs are varying levels of reactive. If you are confused on the difference ask an actual dog trainer. Most are very active on the social medias. I can @ several of the more respected ones throughout the country if you’d like. #notcesarmilan

What says the mob?I left my dog away from the crag, off trail in a good spot with my 12 year daughter, who likes to draw while my wife and I climb. My dog is a blue heeler (yes they have a propensity for being protective and nipping), and she is a sensitive rescue dog that "fell off the back of a truck in NM". She is sweet and loving but weary of people. She doesn't bark, and only sleeps at the crag. All of a sudden a younger dude, climber, ran down the hill stomping on the talus. He went off the main trail and towards my dog and daughter. My daughter flinched at the noise and my dog got scared and tried to nip him as he came within 3 feet of my daughter. My dog barely missed getting the back of his pants as he leapt out of the way and she was on a leash. What does the climber own in this conflict? I took my dog away from the trail. I leashed my dog, who was quiet all day. My daughter was with my dog. Who's at fault here?You had the dog off trail and on leash. It was under control.  That's the bottom line. If a dog is unleashed AND it wanders around getting into other's stuff, fighting other dogs, barking incessantly, etc. it's not in control. THAT is the problem. Not that a dog happens to be at the crag. If a dude is so unaware that he stumbles off trail within 3 feet of a 12 year old girl and a dog that's on him. The fact that he did that and did NOT get bit because you had an appropriate length leash shows you did nothing wrong. I'd probably do the exact same thing. If I had a 12 year old daughter and I'm preoccupied with climbing and can't protect her I damn well would have a dog there leashed to protect her, and the being protective and nippy is a bonus. Now that dog should never be along the base of a crag where people are walking by and it could bite someone, but entirely different situation if it's off trail and someone needs to be clueless to end up within leash distance.

All it takes is a 30 minute drive on a high clearance dirt road or a 30+ minute approach and there's many crags (at least in the West) where there's usually no one else. When I've been at crags like this and when other climbers show up they often approach with their dogs off leash too. But for the popular crags with an easy drive / approach and many climbers my dog (when allowed) is always leashed and I don't play music. I've seen dogs at crags hundreds of times and there's only been a few times dogs were a problem. It's been the idiots who leave their dog unattended while they do a multipitch or a dog that's ready to fight other dogs. I rescued a couple dogs in the past that I never brought to a crag because they weren't suitable. But I'll continue to bring my current dog and any dog I find suitable despite the hand wringing that goes on.

I copy and paste (using the snipping tool) into an Excell spreadsheet. In Excell there's a wide range of line types and features (also shapes and symbols) to choose from. Excell allows you to easily move portions of lines after drawing them, so it's not a one shot attempt. Word and PowerPoint have the same capability but their "canvas" size is set which can be annoying in some situations.

I have 5.10 moccasyms that are comfortable for hand cracks but thats about it. Pretty much hate them other than the comfort. La Sportiva Miuras for sport and currently what I use for thin cracks but they can be painful. They work well for sport for me, and do a decent job getting my toe into thin cracks.In the past I used a very cheap, entry-level, neutral sole shoe for thin cracks and was shocked at how well they worked.

I have katanas and have tried them on thin cracks, I know I'm going against the grain here but I hate them. The extra rubber on the toe (similar to solutions) makes me regret buying them.I use the Evolv Rave moccasins for thin cracks and I like them. They're softer and I feel like they do a decent job of molding into thin cracks when a rand smear is as good as you'll get

TC pros do NOT fit my feet. Even upsizing is just painful - the toe box is too narrow for me unfortunately. Someone above said Katana has a pointy toe - that sounds very useful for thin cracks.

I was standing in the store looking at different shoes for thin cracks. Looking at the toes of various shoes I found that the La Sportiva Finale had a very narrow rubber toe. I went with a comfortable size (not toe crushing). I tried them on the gym cracks last night and was very happy. I can update later how they perform outside. For reference the crack sizes I am interested in are 0.5s, 0.75s, and 1s.

Observation from travels: Most crags have a "best grade", where there is the highest concentration of great climbs, and what that bets grade is varies widely between areas. Some areas are beginners paradise, stacked with great moderates but the harder routes are spare or unpleasant. Whereas other areas the climbs keep getting better as you go up the scale... until you hit a point of dimishing returns. There's usually a range where it is best, but within that range you can often name a single grade that has the most classics. For instance, you could have a sport crag that is pretty good through the 12s and 13s, but for whatever reason 12c is particularly stacked with especially enjoyable routes. Thus 12c would be crag's "best grade". This isn't to say that there aren't grade routes above and below that grade, but if you had to choose one, that would be it.No particular practical application intended here, just an entertaining thought experiment. And this is undoubtedly subjective, which is what makes it interesting. Argue away. For instance, what is the best grade at the Red? The New? Etc...

most of this conversation is above my pay grade and or outside my travels but I  agree with Seneca though they do have some really good 5.8s as well. I would also argue that many of the 5.4 through 5.6 climbs at seneca are really great 5.7s anyways ;)  Gunks thas a tough call as there are so many great climbs at all the lower grades.

I’d say 5.9 at cathedral ledges is the juicy grade there packed with lots of classic at that grade. The city of rocks I’d say is 5.8 and then again at 5.11a/b for both sport and traditional.I’m not pulling hard enough for 12d in Squamish but I haven’t been to any other place with so many good 5.10s {cathedral 5.9 :) }

Also, I think 5.8 is pretty great there too (Saigon, The Corner, Bombardment, Pine Tree, Turner's Flake, etc), as is 10a (Diedre, Nutcracker, Book of Solemnity, etc) so it's bookended by some great climbs above+below. Those north end 5.9s are about as good as 5.9 crack climbing gets, though. Man, what a great crag to cut your teeth on proper granite trad climbing. I did my first trad lead and first multipitch there so I'll always have a sweet spot for Cathedral even if i suck at that slick granite style.To add another few to the list: 5.3 seems to be 'the grade' for east facing flatirons scrambles, and 13a seems to be the grade for the west-facing overhangs (not that I'd know).

I've always thought that at the Owens River Gorge mid 5.11 is a real sweet spot. Routes like Santana, Skeletons in The Closet, Venom, and DWP come to mind. Of course there are some great harder routes as well, but the rock doesn't seem to offer up much at the very high grades, so it's not exactly a destination for climbers looking to pull a bunch of 5.13's. In Joshua Tree the 5.11a/b zone holds a special place in my heart. It's partly for historical reasons; routes like Jumping Jack Crack were some of the first climbs to break the 5.10 barrier. It's also for personal reasons; a lot of my first leads at that grade were in Josh. So many excellent adventures on 5.11 mega-classics. Swept Away, Coarse and Buggy, Bendix Claws, Natural Selection...

Loved the first editions. Really well done. Spent a season there and don't remember any errors in particular, although I'm sure there were some because I've found errors in damn near every guidebook I've ever owned. If you can't get by with a few errors in a book, you're already screwed. Most authors don't bother to fix it. Cool that this one did. Even without corrections, these are some of the highest quality guidebooks I own. I never knew the select edition claimed new routes. When I looked at it, I passed because I figured it was just a combination of select routes already in the first two books.

To reiterate my post this is a REPRINT of the books. My original printing was a small run which I sold out of 2 years ago. The Cochise Stronghold is a difficult place to navigate using MP descriptions. The trails and the domes are convoluted and good maps are essential. People frantically write me requesting books saying they spent their first few days using MP- wasting  their precious vacation. They ask if they can drive over and pick up a copy. The books are an excellent resource that I wanted to make available again.In the time since publication, there have been more people exploring but route development is not prolific enough to justify a new edition.......yet. Adding even just a few routes to the existing books means adjusting the ENTIRE book. To clarify, it took over 10 years to write these first 2 books and 75% of that time is spent in front of a computer. I cannot convey to you the exponential amount of frustration and time it takes to ensure that each dot, and each line is exactly right. I am so much more gracious now when I go to a new area and find little errors-I then humbly offer feedback to the author. I can empathize that when sizing a photo the overlay graphics can shift ever so slightly and ruin the descriptions so each page has to be meticulously reviewed multiple times. There are errors-you are a tough audience and I know you will find them. Maybe I rapped in the dark and couldn't remember if the rap was 90' or 95' but I did it with a 60M rope so I knew using either number would be safe.  If I was not sure if the pitch was 8 or 9 bolts I would round up to 9. With all the other research I had to do I didn't have time to go back. These were the errors that people wrote to me about and I was able to correct. Nothing that was glaringly dangerous but things that prevent confusion when your looking for another bolt but end up at an anchor. The feedback I got from the first books was that people LOVE them. They have opened up entire new areas and their ability to climb in the Stronghold because they offer more then just the old school dangerous routes. I also heard from those who are just visiting, or only climb here occasionally, that they didn't need to have a set. The "Select Edition" was created for them. I removed the no star and one star routes. The routes chosen are the ones that I, as the author, felt provided people the most "bang for their buck" when looking to experience what the Stronghold has to offer. The book focuses on routes that the largest number of people are looking to get on. Safe, Quality Rock, Hint of Adventure, but still provide the old school classics.My advertisement on MP says "I only have 15 sets of the Complete Guidebooks left so this spring I published a Select Edition for those who just want to hit the classics, the beaten path, or are traveling through. I must warn you though.... in due time you will love the place and wish for more! "I also wrote "‘This Select Edition offers you 845 pitches on over 300 of the most sought after routes hand picked from our comprehensive East And West Side guidebooks."The Complete set offers over 900 routes and many thousands of pitches....so get out there. There is much climbing to be done and I hope you end up loving the place as  much as I do!

Guidebook writing is an unbelievably labor intensive effort that never receives commensurate compensation, but always has plenty of critics. Personally, the mystery and challenges of discovery are a huge part of the appeal of a place like the Stronghold, and guidebooks seem to detract from that. But I greatly respect the effort that is invested in a project like this- kudos.

But I greatly respect the effort that is invested in a project like this- kudos.I remember running into an old climbing legend in the parking lot going into Temple Crag. We talked about how I had started the Cochise guidebooks and he said at one time he was given the privilege to continue on the legacy of a guidebook to an area. He said he "killed the book". He said he kept with the very old school style of descriptions "Climb the east ridge, surmount the gendarme obstacles along the way to achieve the summit". He encouraged me to find a balance. Tell enough to motivate and paint a picture, provide enough detail to get up and down safely, but mostly to inspire and share the area with others that were always scared away.I chose to not reveal gear placements (climbing is a puzzle), and I resisted adding hints that would reveal a right VS left side in on a crack. I made a very conscious effort to keep the books on the side of adventure but guide you to possibilities you might not have known were there.

So having climbed a decent amount in both Squamish and Yosemite over the last few years, I have slowly come to the conclusion that for the average climber, Squamish is objectively the best granite climbing area in North America. Let me elaborate:1. Location/Travel: Winner SquamishFor those just visiting, Squamish is easily accessible through multiple international airports and has actual travel infrastructure to get there. Yosemite is somewhat in the middle of nowhere and there is no truly close airport to fly into. Travel to Yosemite is also affected when the pass closes making it very annoying to get to if you live to the east of the park and driving.2. Location/Living There: Winner SquamishThis feeds into how nice it is to have it as a weekend trip-able destination. The closest metro areas to squamish have an abundance of jobs and it is pretty reasonable to drive up to to Squamish (or other area crags) if you live in Vancouver or Seattle. The largest area with a significant amount of work to Yosemite is the Bay Area, which (from experience) is quite a slog from Yosemite (especially the east side). Vancouver/Seattle also have a lot more local options as a climber than the Bay Area does.3. Camping: Winner SquamishCamping is significantly easier in Squamish, getting reservations in Yosemite is a huge pain and one can get hit with large fines if they camp illegally in the park. If one wants to camp outside the park they have to drive significant distances to either loud roadside camping or primitive pullouts.4. Food: Winner SquamishWhile Yosemite has the pizza deck and the village store (which is surprisingly affordable) there really isn't much in terms of options in terms of getting food or stocking up when in the park. Squamish has multiple grocery stores, fast food (with wifi) and restaurants within walking distance to the chief. I have spent a bunch of time there without a car fairly easily.5. Getting around: Winner SquamishSquamish proper is fairly walkable, pretty easy to get food, go to the community center, hit up some boulders, go cragging  all without a car or even a bike. The valley during peak season is a zoo to get around. Always a giant traffic jam and realistically quite a long walk to get around the valley. Add it on to the fact that you need a car to be able to drive out of the park to camp it kind of sucks.6. Rest day activities: Winner SquamishSquamish and surrounding area has better indoor things to do (access to library or cell phone to work), and a ton of outdoor activities as well (mountain biking, kite boarding, skiing, trail running). Yosemite has some okay hikes but lacks reception or those other things.Now to some more contentious comparisons:7. Variety of climbing: Winner SquamishSquamish in my opinion has a wider variety of climbing than the valley. Better access to actual good sport climbing, world class bouldering, awesome cragging as well as longer routes of varying grades. There are heinous heady test pieces, overhung pitches, fun slab romps, you can kind of pick whatever you want to do. I find Yosemite doesn't have some styles or at least not in a decent quantity, and particularly the sport climbing really lacks. Squamish is also a lot more dense of a climbing area, you can find hundreds of routes within a short hike versus the more spread out valley.8. Multipitch Free climbing: Winner SquamishI think for the AVERAGE climber (<5.12 multipitch), you are much better served by climbing on the chief and other formations than climbing in the valley. The approaches are all super short and not contrived, there are less mungy pitches (in my opinion), there is an awesome spread of grades and especially the moderates I have climbed are just plain more fun. You can even climb 12+ pitches and 30 minutes latter be cooking dinner. Some of the coolest pitches I have ever seen/done are in the valley but I have also seen my partner dig out cracks with their nut tool more than I can count. I think if you are a mutant that can free the captain maybe you are better served by the valley but I am a weak motherfucker and think squamish is just higher quality in the grades I climb. The stone itself in squamish is also just less pinned out, less polished and more grippy.9. Aid climbing: Winner YosemiteI think if you get your rocks off by pulling on widgets and vertical camping, Yosemite is by far the best place in N.A. if not the world. Same goes if you are a freak that can free climb on the captain.10. History: Winner YosemiteFor sure Yosemite has some cool history and one should definitely visit it at some point. It is cool to think of what happened here in the last 65 years. My hot take is that I think this clouds peoples judgement when assessing the quality of climbing in the valley.Total Score: Squamish (8) vs Yosemite (2)I think both locations are cool but if I had to choose one between the two, I think Squamish is objectively a better choice for us mortals. Curious to see what others would break it down as over these 10 categories.Actually Squamish sucks, don't go.

You forgot weather, aka number of climbable days per season, which is pretty important whether you're planning a trip or considering a place to live. Also to consider: backcountry climbing.  I have no idea how many big backcountry formations you can hike to and have all to yourself in Squamish, but that's important to some people too.How would you rank those two?

The valley is not too hot and not too cold about the same ammount of time that squamish is climbable imo.

 Rain is your biggest problem in the PNW but there is a decent amount of climbing that can happen in the rain still. The valley is not too hot and not too cold about the same amount of time that squamish is climbable imo.It is also worth differentiating the weather/season for the visiting road trip climber, versus the local.For the visiting road trip climber, the issue of rain in Squamish is somewhat overblown, since these climbers mostly go in July/August, when the weather is very reliably dry. For an area to be a good destination, it doesn't matter whether an area is good year round, it just matters that the area have a solid reliable window in which to visit. Squamish has that. If anything, the Squamish season is advantageous since it is good in mid-summer, when most convenient non-alpine climbing areas in North America are too hot. By contrast, Yosemite Valley is good in spring and fall, which means it competes for season with most of the other North American destinations. Also, spring and fall in Yosemite Valley aren't that reliable anyway - you can still get stormed on in these periods. Arguably, Squamish summer is more reliable for the visiting climber than Yosemite in fall.Some caveats though, that work against Squamish:- The comparison above is considering these as destinations to visit. It's a very different situation for the locals. The PNW is magical to visit in the summer, but for the year round locals the long dark rainy PNW is brutal. So even if Squamish is arguably the better place to visit, for year round living I'd much rather live in California. Especially since...- The weather/season comparison really only holds up in favor of Squamish if limiting the comparison to Squamish vs Yosemite Valley. But really we should consider Yosemite Valley plus Tuolumne, which really expands the length of the good season. Squamish can't compete with that.- The typical Squamish summer weather (sunny, 70s) is generally good for multipitch crack climbing, but is still a bit on the warm side for certain forms of climbing, most notably hard bouldering. The problem with Squamish and the west side PNW generally is that it is generally either warm or wet, with few/unreliable windows of cold and dry. For those wanting crisp bouldering temperatures, Yosemite (in the appropriate season) is an easier place to find that. Again, especially if Tuolumne-inclusive.---In summary, the Squamish season is pretty great actually for the visiting trad climber who has the flexibility to choose when to go. But for the year round local or regional climber who is stuck there through the rainy winter, it is a lot less awesome. Finding a window to visit for good bouldering conditions is also less than ideal.

Another category to consider:11. Regional Climbing Resources: Winner YosemiteWhile Squamish may be arguably favorable in a strict comparison to just Yosemite Valley, once you expand the radius to include the broader area it shifts the balance. For quantity, quality, and variety of rock climbing, plus year round season, the broader Sierra Nevada region in a 4-ish hour radius around Yosemite (including portions of the High Sierra, Mammoth, Bishop, Sonora region, south Tahoe, etc...) is a solid winner as compared the the 4 hour radius around Squamish. In my opinion, at least.

2. Location/Living There: Winner SquamishThis feeds into how nice it is to have it as a weekend trip-able destination. The closest metro areas to squamish have an abundance of jobs and it is pretty reasonable to drive up to to Squamish (or other area crags) if you live in Vancouver or Seattle. The largest area with a significant amount of work to Yosemite is the Bay Area, which (from experience) is quite a slog from Yosemite (especially the east side). Vancouver/Seattle also have a lot more local options as a climber than the Bay Area does.Kinda disagree with this one, at least from a US citizen perspective. Vancouver is close to Squamish but is ruinously expensive to live there. Living in Squamish proper would be amazing, but work and cost is challenging. Plus, as an American living on the Canadian side involves fairly challenging legal residency issues.If stuck living on the US side of the border, you aren't that close to Squamish. The Seattle to Squamish commute is pretty grim these days. The combination of Seattle/Everett traffic, the border, and Vancouver traffic make it a hassle unless you drive in the middle of the night. Bellingham is nice and is closer to Squamish, but not that close, is lacking for good local climbing, and the job situation is tricky. Plus in all these places you are living in the rain for the winter.For the California side of the comparison: Yes, living in the Bay sucks. Don't do it. But there are other places to live. The Central Valley + Foothills exists, and isn't the wasteland that people seem to think. Sacramento is a great home base actually. I've lived in Seattle and Sacramento, and find the Sac to Yosemite drive to be vastly easier than Seattle to Squamish. Plus Tahoe >> Index (I stand by that...fight me).Summary: If you have or can get Canadian residency and afford to live in Squamish/Vancouver, by all means do that. But if living on the US side of the border, NorCal (not the Bay) has some serious advantages over western WA.

So having climbed a decent amount in both Squamish and Yosemite over the last few years, I have slowly come to the conclusion that for the average climber, Squamish is objectively the best granite climbing area in North America. Let me elaborate:1. Location/Travel: Winner SquamishFor those just visiting, Squamish is easily accessible through multiple international airports and has actual travel infrastructure to get there. Yosemite is somewhat in the middle of nowhere and there is no truly close airport to fly into. Travel to Yosemite is also affected when the pass closes making it very annoying to get to if you live to the east of the park and driving.2.

The highway that runs underneath The Chief generates intrusive traffic noise and spoils the aesthetic experience of climbing there. The traffic noise in Squamish bears no comparison to Yosemite traffic (if only they would ban all vehicles in Yosemite). The Chief is also set in an industrial setting (logging) and impressive nevertheless.

All the other campgrounds in the area are reserve-only.2. It may be easier to get around in Squamish, but the routes themselves (at least these days) are an absolute zoo.

I love both Yosemite and Squamish. Both are very different and have their pros and cons.My main problem with Squamish as a sweaty person is that it's never dry enough for me to climb hard. When it's not raining it's still too warm and humid. On any sustained routes my hands were soaking wet and no amount of chalk would dry them out.Bouldering wasn't as bad as route climbing because of the shorter duration on the rock. I was able to send V7 in Squamish compared to V9 on Sierra granite. But for trad/sport that was sustained, 11a felt like my limit compared to 13a on Sierra granite.With that said, I had probably the best 6 weeks of my life in Squamish this summer!

The Chief at weekends is saturated by climbers from Vancouver. Finding a camping spot is problematic. The Chief Rangers appear to be friendly and amenable to climbers. By all accounts a group of Spanish climbers in the fall of 2022 were held at gunpoint in the Camp 4 parking lot and handcuffed. I believe their mistake was to drive through a red stop sign.

I genuinely think squamish is my favorite place to rock climb, and probably one of the most well rounded climbing areas I can think of.  But the noise when climbing the chief was completely SHOCKING to me when I arrived.  You're climbing above a highway that's utilized by tractor trailers shifting gears just as much as folks blasting music flying by with their windows down.  Noise is just noise and it's whatever, but it is much more intrusive than the slowly moving parking lot that is the valley.

The latter can be really solid, but neither come close to proper granite. There are other granite spots in BC but they’re more of an adventure destination. I lived in the Canadian Rockies most of my life, if you’re into pure rock climbing, Squamish is hands down the best in Canada. Canmore has a better concentration of hard sport routes, but the approaches are generally longer and the weather is less predictable. A long Squamish approach is half an hour and many will complain. However, if you walk that far, you’re likely to avoid the crowds. There are an almost endless supply of small crags with great routes. The crowds are getting pretty bonkers at the usual places and will only get worse with time. That said, as soon as you start climbing into the 11’s on multis (Grand Wall excepted), the number of suitors dies off drastically. I’ve only climbed at Index as far as American destinations go, and it was not quite what I’d call user friendly in comparison. The climbing is excellent and the bar for entry certainly eliminates the Gumby factor by orders of magnitude.

No other granite area in North America, and arguably the world, can match its combination of rock quality, terrain, stable weather, accessibility, and just all around good climbing. Yosemite is of course the most famous and crowded zone within the range, but that's just a tiny portion of what's there. There's lifetimes of high quality, uncrowded developed granite climbing, both roadside and backcountry, alpine and lower elevation. Not to mention FA potential.To go bigger and better than the Sierra you have to start looking at places like Baffin, Patagonia, the Karakorum... But these areas are of course vastly more difficult in terms of access, logistics, weather. Just a different category from an accessible "home range" like the Sierra.Within North America, you could maybe make an argument for the Bugs or the Winds. Which are amazing alpine granite. But they don't have the variety the Sierra offers with the alpine/backcountry rock and also super accessible roadside rock. They also don't match the Sierra in quantity, or stability of weather.For amount of variety, quantity, quality, accessibility in one super concentrated area, Squamish probably beats any single small zone of the Sierra. Now we're back to the OP, comparing Squamish and Yosemite. But for broader regions, the Sierra beats BC/PNW. Again, based on quality, accessibility, weather...

 If we zoom out to larger regions, it has to the the Sierra Nevada. No other granite area in North America, and arguably the world, can match its combination of rock quality, terrain, stable weather, accessibility, and just all around good climbing. Yosemite is of course the most famous and crowded zone within the range, but that's just a tiny portion of what's there. There's lifetimes of high quality, uncrowded developed granite climbing, both roadside and backcountry, alpine and lower elevation. Not to mention FA potential.To go bigger and better than the Sierra you have to start looking at places like Baffin, Patagonia, the Karakorum... But these areas are of course vastly more difficult in terms of access, logistics, weather. Just a different category from an accessible "home range" like the Sierra.Within North America, you could maybe make an argument for the Bugs or the Winds. Which are amazing alpine granite. But they don't have the variety the Sierra offers with the alpine/backcountry rock and also super accessible roadside rock. They also don't match the Sierra in quantity, or stability of weather.For amount of variety, quantity, quality, accessibility in one super concentrated area, Squamish probably beats any single small zone of the Sierra.

 Tldr: Yosemite wins Grand scheme of things, yes.But zooming in again and  returning to OP question, here's one way to frame it. A climber is planning a 2 week trip next year to a granite area. They can go to Squamish in late August or Yosemite in October. Which would be the better choice for the climbing vacation?It really depends on who they are and what they are looking for. OP makes some great points though, that for many -  possibly most - climbers, Squamish is actually the better option and would suit their interests better.

Has anyone bought up the cost of living? Apologies if this has been bought up. When I wanted to retire in Squamish or Pemberton the price of a single family house was over million CAD which in USD is still as*load. Whistler was way outta the question. Has the market gotten better?Is it easier to live in the Sea to Sky?

One must mention Horne Lake and Skaha Bluffs when discussing the greater squamish/BC climbing. Although skaha is a bit far at about a 6h drive, it can be claimable any month of the year, and is best in fall and spring. Horne Lake is about 4h commute from squamish including the ferry ride but boasts world class limestone tufa climbing in an unbelievable setting, and is climbable between march-nov/dec and is completely rain protected. With the addition of these areas being based in squamish/Vancouver the climbing season is realistically March to November with peak season being the summer. Conveniently that leaves you 4ish months to enjoy crispy American desert weather.

OP conflated these somewhat.If you're deciding where to take a 2 week climbing trip next year, Squamish vs Yosemite, how much the houses cost isn't really a meaningful distinction. But it is is you're deciding where to move long term.

Now that is a hot take. For the road tripping climber, I'd thoroughly disagree with that. Squamish and Yosemite are better trip destinations., even if the camping is a hassle.As a place to live long term, yeah I think Tahoe wins. Especially if you're inclusive of the greater Tahoe region which offers various pragmatic places to live/work for the normal folks who want a house and job.There's another interesting debate of Tahoe vs Index/Leavenworth. If Squamish and Yosemite are the granite A team, Tahoe and Index/Leavenworth are the B team. But which is the captain of the B team?  Could add in Little Cottonwood, the South Platte, and the Idyllwild area also for the B team showdown.

In terms of the average climber not getting on the captain or big 1000ft walls, yes I think so. Multiple rock types/ styles, camping/lodging/could live there, convenient and different on food it’s hard to beat. Sure no mega big routes but plenty to choose from and fairly easy to find seclusion. Certainly not on the A team but top contender for B team. But it really does check those comfortized bullet points.

Certainly not on the A team but top contender for B team. But it really does check those comfortized bullet points.Let's do the OP categories:Tahoe vs Squamish1. Location/Travel: Winner Tahoe (small margin).Easy highway access and airport accessibility from Reno or Sac. More ways in or out of the area, vs just the Sea to Sky.2. Location/Living There: Winner TahoeGreater number of living options/environments to choose from, and more reasonable affordability down the hill on the Nevada side.3. Camping: Winner TahoeTahoe wins by a huge margin. Lots of legal dispersed camping, and semi legal van parking. Never get hassled by rangers. Much easier to show up on a Friday night and easily find somewhere to sleep.4. Food: TieIDK. Both are fine and have ample options. I cook my own food anyway. Tie. 5. Getting around: Winner SquamishSquamish is a much more compact area, so it wins this one just based on areas being closer together and often bikeable from town.6. Rest day activities: TieBoth have ample options for hikes, MTB, and water activities. Edge to Tahoe for having better lakes/beaches. Squamish is better for MTB, but that's not really a rest day. Both are great.7. Variety of climbing: Winner SquamishBouldering and 1-4 pitch trad cragging are a tie; both are great in both places.  Squamish has much better sport climbing and long multipitch. Squamish also is much more concentrated, vs very spread out nature of Tahoe. Squamish wins overall for excelling across a larger number of climbing disciplines, plus the dense concentration. 8. Multipitch Free climbing: Winner SquamishClear win to Squamish here, except at the easier grades. Tahoe has an edge on the easy stuff with Lovers Leap and Emigrant Wall. But for everything else Squamish offers a better concentration of tall quality multipitch. Tahoe is just shorter, for the most part. Cal Dome is cool but loses points for being so remote and having a tricky season.9. Aid climbing: Winner NeitherI guess Squamish technically wins this one over Tahoe, but really if you want to aid climb just go to Yosemite.10. History: Tie / I don't care.Both have their local history, characters, classics, and testpieces. Meh.------Conclusion: 3 points to Tahoe, 3 points to Squamish, 4 categories a tie.Overall, Squamish has better climbing but Tahoe is an easier place to exist.  I think Squamish wins as a place to visit and Tahoe wins as a place to live. Overall a better result for Tahoe than I expected.Note: Used to visit Squamish a lot, and now Tahoe is my home area. Love them both. Tahoe doing so well in this lineup vs Squamish gives me some pride in the home area.Additional note: On the bouldering I think Tahoe wins on variety and quantity but Squamish wins on density and consistent quality.

Jcm thanks for the break down that’s about where I landed aswell, except for there’s waaaayyy more easy/ beginner stuff around Tahoe then what you mentioned( undoubtedly some of these are on the less classic more obscure side and iv never underwood the ewall being classic other than the bolting)Plus all the boulder in Tahoe is pretty stacked. It’s a pretty close comparison for one being B and one being A tier I was just there and miss Tahoe greatly. So much climbing and skiing for a life time

Really easy to compare Squamish to Tahoe or Yosemite or North Conway. Trying to compare Squamish to JTree... Not even sure how to do that really.In any case, I vote B tier for JTree. I don't like it, but many do, so B seems fair.

I know that Deven says that the chart that he posted is an incomplete ‘starter’ , but I’m still surprised that it didn’t include such areas as Tahquitz/Suicide or, other than Tahoe, any of the other multiple areas on the Sierra ‘fringes’ such as Courtright or Shuteye—though I realize they don’t have the ‘civilized amenities’ of Yosemite or Squamish—but that is a big part of their charm.

Rather than nitpick the relative merits of Courtright vs Tuolumne vs Whitney Portal, just group together and say it's all great. There's too many good areas to try to name them all anyway. He did the same lumping with the PNW granite (WA Cascades + Squamish).Some missing areas include:The San Jacinto range (Idyllwild, Black Mountain, Tramway) CO Front Range granite (Lumpy, Evans, SPlatte, BoCan, Poudre, etc)These comparisons get funny because you start comparing areas of disparate size. Comparing City of Rocks to the entire Sierra Nevada range isn't really reasonable. What is an "area" anyway?

Greenplates are an invasive species seen in Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, California, Oregon and northern Arizona. They are characterized by a disregard of local and environmental ethics and believe that Boulder is the center of the universe. Because greenplates travel great distances for quality rock (their native rock is chossy at best), they are often first heard in a parking lot arriving at midnight and slamming doors for an hour. They may also be heard with bluetooth speakers playing some loud bass vibes music.Greenplates are often adorned with bright, new Cotopaxi and Patagonia gear. Cryptobiotic soil is in their way, and every tree is their fire wood.

I have listened to a recent interview with Chris Sharma... and keep coming back to this part.  Sums up everything I want to remember as this new climbing season begins here in Josh.  Hope everyone is having a great day, week and life!  "It's not easy when you put yourself out there on a project and you put everything into it and you are faced with the possibility of failure, and for me, specifically with that route, being in my 40's I missed some important eras.  Preparing yourself for failure can be very intense. But it's also very liberating.  When I look back, whether it was Jumbo Love, or Biographie, La Dura Dura, I always felt like looking back on it I could have done each climb quicker but there was this mental factor that caused it to drag on much longer which took me through the wringer of a whole emotional roller coaster, feeling rejected and having to let it go.  It really is a pretty cool process that can take you to some pretty deep and dark places within and forces you to look at yourself and one of the cool things about most projects is it really does get engaged on a very deep level, and climbing, as a life path, it's important to have those intense experiences.  There are so many iterations of climbing -- going out and having fun and being in nature, but it's also about being a life path... and it's important to have those tough moments, to really focus on accomplishments, have goals, work towards them... the classic thing is that it's about the process not about getting to the top, but if you never get to the top then what are you doing?  It has to be in there, putting yourself in a vulnerable place on something that you might not succeed on and committing yourself wholeheartedly to that, and potentially walking away empty handed.  It's a scary place." "The mindset of success is the pure joy of climbing.  I don't think it's enough to just think you can do something.  Sometimes you have to go out and actually do it. In the end, there's always going to be someone better... there's always going to be someone stronger. Forget about any of the grades and just focus on the sensation of how do I feel when moving on the rock?  If you focus on sensation, it's the relationship between your body and the rock, and you can have that, whatever level you are at.  It is cool from time to time to test yourself... we need that for validation, as well, to know that we are not completely abstract.  I just want to remind people that, as easy as it is to get caught up in what other people are doing and where we stand, every person is their own universe, and if we climb the best that we can, and be the best version of ourselves, climbing is completely personal experience... and if you can find a way to climb to your potential then you are the best in the world."

I saw both Apogee and T Hocking posting to the earlier (now maxed out) "Over 50" thread. I recall that in the Supertopo days both of you were interested and supportive of my efforts to hike the Pacific Crest Trail in consecutive pieces with my two daughters.So I thought you might be interested in an update of those efforts. We've continued with lots of fun and a fair amount of success. My older daughter, the one who stopped going on every trip with us when she left for college (still in Supertopo days), resumed her "continuous footsteps from Mexico" with me this summer. I did a trip report as always to the Pinnacles climbing forum that I frequent:http://www.mudncrud.com/forums/index.php?topic=2977.0And although my younger daughter has been off at college too, and unable to devote quite as much time to our adventure, she and I did a trip this summer that added to our continuous footsteps from Mexico. She and I have now done 2,540.9 miles, in order, over 17 years. Next summer we'll almost certainly finish the remaining 110 miles into Canada (and then what will I do with my life).http://www.mudncrud.com/forums/index.php?topic=3077.0I've never met either of you, but have always remembered and been grateful for your interest in our adventure.

Had a nice gym sesh tonight on some of the comp routes I failed on last Sat. All the gym routes start easy and end hard. It’s actually really fun, rather than the norm of routes set to be reasonably consistent in grade through its length. Rode my motorcycle home in the dark through the Adelaide hills’ twisties. It was a bit harrowing; riding a motorcycle in the complete darkness through corners with the danger of foxes and kangaroos bouncing out at you isn’t all that fun. ‘Roos are especially problematic, because they bounce in almost random directions and some are BIG at least foxes run straight across the road. Off to Araps soon in a few weeks. I need grounding.

I've had my upcoming 70th birthday on my mind... too much.  I feel like I'm in one of Gail Sheehy's "Passages" where you just have to fumble your way through a dark time.  I think Rich has something to say about all of this and I'm sure ready for some rgold wisdom.    I had a beautiful late afternoon out with Bob yesterday--first outing in quite awhile, and I just wanted to be present and listen to my body on rock. I had declared it to be the first official day of my personal climbing year. So this was a trial run.  How am I feeling?  Is this still healthy for me?  Where am I at physically on rock?  I do have those four climbing goals this year.  (Decompensator, Trix, Elephants and White Room).  Are those ridiculous goals now? One thing I know for sure, this past year of illness and being sedentary has cost me a lot of muscle. I'm surprised how rapidly it went. If muscle is also an endocrine gland (which it is), then it's also cost me metabolism and mood and a lot of other things.  I woke up this morning realizing that there are some commitments to make, if I want to climb:  I have to focus on strength and weights.  If I want to climb hard, without better strength foundation, I'm only going to injure myself and be forced to quit.  I almost hate to be the old saw here... I just wish this didn't feel like a nearly untraveled road.  Rapidly being dropped in the bucket of 'old', no one really knows what to do with you at this point.  How much weights?  What diet?  What not to do?  How hard to go?  "Even you can climb into your 40's."  Yea... what about 60's and 70's?  There was some alarm at my heart rate while climbing, and a few doctors had to confer to decide whether I was about to drop due to a heart attack, or whether this was ok.   My Kaiser doctors have become my biggest fans... "Whatever you want." is their motto.  You want testing?  You want meds?  Well, what I WANT is to learn what is the safest, most reasonable, data-backed protocol for being the healthiest and best rock climber I can be.  (at this age).  -----I really enjoyed some easy routes with Bob yesterday.  He showed me a new inspirational line one day maybe to climb.  And then, just as I was completely worn out and done for the day... Bob pointed to a short steep slab that looked SO fun, and SO hard.  "We can come back and climb that another time."  NO!  I want to climb it NOW!    Man... all my energy and joy and stoke returned just like that.  So new lesson, if it calls to you, go do it.  My Registered Dietician, who I initially saw for diabetes, is also a Type 1 Diabetic and much younger athlete.  What he continues to tell me "Lori, you just didn't understand the magnitude of fueling and care you need to keep doing what you do. Your normal feeding was not enough for the challenge.  But now months (and months) of meeting protein targets, supplementing, hydrating and so many other things has put you back in business."  BTW... he's not a huge supplement fan, but first and foremost directs me back to food.  Ok. that's a start.  Obviously... the question couched in this post is "What do you all do?"

Lori, It is quite clear that there is not a ‘one size fits all’ answer to your question or that what works for any of us, would necessarily be right for you. Other then some general principles ( and I’m not sure that we would all even agree on them!!!), it is a very individualized determination. We each have our own challenges and circumstances, both internal and external, which impact what we need to do to continue to perform at the levels that are ‘right’ for us.  For example, as you yourself have noted multiple times, things will likely be different for someone like you who started at a more advanced age than it will be for those of us who are lifers, with so many climbing-relevant ‘engrams’ wired into our ‘systems’. I think it requires a fair amount of trial and error to figure what will work best for each of us—-and that always subject to change at short notice as our circumstances change—as they are very apt to do at this stage of our lives.

I've had my upcoming 70th birthday on my mind... too much.  I feel like I'm in one of Gail Sheehy's "Passages" where you just have to fumble your way through a dark time.  I think Rich has something to say about all of this and I'm sure ready for some rgold wisdom.    I'm about to turn 80.  I think we tend to put too much emphasis on milestones.  It's another year, and to quote an old Jewish saying I think I've posted here before, if you want to give god a good laugh, tell him your plans. My best advice is, "keep on truckin'."  What that means to you at any one particular moment is going to change, but the concept is the point.One thing I know for sure, this past year of illness and being sedentary has cost me a lot of muscle. I'm surprised how rapidly it went. If muscle is also an endocrine gland (which it is), then it's also cost me metabolism and mood and a lot of other things.  I woke up this morning realizing that there are some commitments to make, if I want to climb:  I have to focus on strength and weights.  If I want to climb hard, without better strength foundation, I'm only going to injure myself and be forced to quit.  I almost hate to be the old saw here... I just wish this didn't feel like a nearly untraveled road.  Rapidly being dropped in the bucket of 'old', no one really knows what to do with you at this point.  How much weights?  What diet?  What not to do?  How hard to go?  "Even you can climb into your 40's."  Yea... what about 60's and 70's?  There was some alarm at my heart rate while climbing, and a few doctors had to confer to decide whether I was about to drop due to a heart attack, or whether this was ok.   My Kaiser doctors have become my biggest fans... "Whatever you want." is their motto.  You want testing?  You want meds?  Well, what I WANT is to learn what is the safest, most reasonable, data-backed protocol for being the healthiest and best rock climber I can be.  (at this age).  Well, here are a few things to think about. First and foremost, there is a big problem the the perfect becoming the enemy of the good.  In that vein, some exercise is better than no exercise.  And there is quite a bit of research that suggests, for those of us who are not elite athletes with extreme performance demands, that almost all set/rep/resistance protocols confer more or less the same benefits., and that everyone, even people in their 90's can make gains. Taken together, it means, as a matter of increasing basic body strength, that almost anything you choose to do will have some benefit, and the details of the exercise don't matter all that much.  It is far more important to find something you will be able to do regularly.There are bazillions of exercises of course.  Climbing is pretty general in its demands.  You want some pulling strength, some pressing strength, some step-up strength, and some foot strength, and a bit of opposing-muscle work to balance things out. One exercise for each should be just dandy, you're not training for a body-building contest.  The best exercise for pulling is, of course, pullups.  If you can't do them, a pulley in a pullup bar converts it into a lat pulldown machine and you can use that with an appropriate resistance.  I think resistance bands are just as good, and there are various strategies that involve having the pullup grips lower, heels on the ground, and the body in an overhanging posture.  Of course, it you go to a gym, there's a real lat pulldown machine and maybe a gravitron for pullups.Pressing.  Probably the best is a press-down exercise with an official or improvised lat-pulldown setup.  The bar or handles or whatever start at shoulder level and you press down, keeping hands close to the body, until arms are straight down.  This isn't going to train very effectively for hard mantles, but it's right for most climbing.Opposing muscles.  I think dumbell presses are king.  If you have a bench with an adjustable back that allows you to do the presses leaning slightly backwards (the way your body orients when doing pullups) that's ideal.  It is probably a good idea to add the standard resistance band exercises for rotator cuff heath; the internet is loaded with descriptions for these.Legs.  Anything that doesn't hurt your knees.  Squats and box step-ups are the obvious choices.  If you get to where added weight seems desirable, you can to box step-ups with a pack.  For squats, I'd suggest hanging a weight from your waist to keep the back out of the equation.  For calfs, one-legged calf raises are the way to go.  Something I've never seen anyone in a gym do but which helps slab climbing is one-legged calf stands. You just raise up on one leg as for a calf raise and then hold that for...a while.  (I find two minutes is about right for me)Sets and reps.  It doesn't matter that much.  Starting out, I'd go for either one set of 20 or three sets of 8, whichever seems more comfortable.  Fuhgettabout momentary muscular failure, just get nice and tired without being totally worked.I think it took longer to type this than the workout. We're talking about maybe five exercises, possibly one set of each.  And there is no need to do them all at once or even more than one exercise per day.A final remark.  I don't think goals are necessarily a good thing.  They might make you push when the intelligent thing is to back off,  The goal should be to do the work, not rise to some level or surpass some previous level.  With respect to that, I don't even record my performances anymore.  I just do what I can do on the day I'm trying to do it.  Mostly I do make progress, but not always, and that's just the way things are.

Brad … Very cool thing to do with your daughters. So get it done. Lori- there is no roadmap for 70 year old climbers to follow- we blaze our own path. One that is relatively unknown. All we can do is keep on keeping on. Carl- isn’t it great when the winter gloom goes away? Everyone needs to say a prayer next Tuesday for Cosmic …. He is having yet another back surgery next Tuesday the 19th. Going Fishing for the next few weekends/days till the snow flies- creeks are finally coming down some.

Thank you so much, all... these conversations always help me more than I can say.  We've solved a lot of problems here, and shared a lot over the years, and sometimes solve things as a team.  I wanted to just say, for clarity, that I didn't just live a life of debauchery up until 65 and then decide to 'get healthy'.  I've been pretty careful and conservative my whole life.  Something changed... I don't know what, in how I feel, act and recover.  But I have heard over and over, the rules all change at 65.  I'm  just trying to find out what the new rules are. :-)  rgold, your words are always magic, and I have printed out most of your posts to keep in front of me, going way back.  So thank you for taking the time to write about exercise.  Just one more thought on this (for now   )... I spent the summer roaming, looking for a handful of routes that would inspire me to work hard.  Interesting how I can  barely muster the energy to take a morning walk on some days, but show me an impossible route with credit card sized edges... and I wake up.  I would never work this hard in a gym.  "Goals" are really my term for something that inspires me, and makes me want to go the distance. I know they say great sex is 99% between the ears.  I would echo that for great climbing, too. -----I just want to leave a follow-up note on our next door neighbor.  Today was the hearing for a Restraining Order... we waited in a full courtroom for hours as case after case of Domestic Violence came through.  So many really angry, fed up people  I had no idea what to expect in our case.  I had been advised that the bar for obtaining a Civil Restraining Order is quite high... you have to have proof, it has to be direct violence aimed directly at you.  The judge also made that clear.  So, when our names were called we walked forward and sat in our respective seats.  The judge warned me that I would need to carry the burden of proof.  And then the hearing commenced.  He asked me to explain what happened that morning, and of any prior encounters that would make Tony and I feel threatened.  So, I started to explain about the SWAT morning, and the morning our neighbor shot himself, and the massive amount of arms, etc.. Very shortly the judge said "I've heard enough. I am going to grant the Restraining Order." and then asked my neighbor if he wanted to respond.  My neighbor said "I love these people, and they have been my best support... and I never want them to feel afraid or threatened, so if it will make them feel better to have a Restraining Order, then I want them to have that.  I'm really going to miss them."  And I started to cry because I was feeling the same way.  It was a very honest moment.  Next, my neighbor started to cry and I could see how shaken up he was...  and then Tony was crying.  I am not sure the judge has ever seen such a situation... the three of us saying we loved and cared about each other, but we needed to be safe, and wishing each other the best.  I felt like the judge was going to break out the hankies next... the whole courtroom was emotional.  In my life there's very little black and white.  I do know that you can care about someone deeply, and yet still have to protect yourself.  Today I am just heartbroken.

For what Lori wants I'm sticking with it doesn't matter.In conclusion, considering the evidence regarding untrained subjects, it seems plausible to suggest that HI-RT to failure is not necessary for maximal increases in strength and hypertrophy. On the other hand, repetitions to failure seem essential for increases in muscle strength and mass of similar magnitude to HI-RT when performing LI-RT. When it comes to trained individuals, evidence show greater increases in muscle strength after HI-RT performed to muscle failure compared to no failure. Similarly to untrained individuals, muscle failure at LI-RT might be an interesting strategy for maximizing muscle hypertrophy. However, it does not promote maximal increases on muscle strength when performed by strength trained individuals.(HI-RT refers to resistance levels above 60% of the one-rep max, LI-RT to resistance levels below that.)

Rich, I'd be willing to bet the subjects in most any research paper out there on working to muscle failure, were probably male. And not 70, but, you (and most on here) certainly have a great many decades of experience with bodies, and coaxing what you want from them. It's definitely different, to be our threads "New", vs the "Experienced", but boy, is it ever nice to all be in the same room chatting!Lori? Nice to hear how that hearing went. And, with all of that going on, wtf are you surprised at all that things feel kinda dark, and this poor innocent birthday gets to take the heat for that?The simple truth?You are a SPECTACULAR outlier as a 70 year old. "Even if you are (or aren't) ____________ " Fill that blank in with any shortcomings your brain attempts to feed you. Then tell it to fuck off. 70?Seems to me you are well entitled to some of that debauchery. Go for it! EDIT to add, Lori, if you have a gym there? Hire a trainer, perhaps? I think it's not just info you need, it's honest to god coaching. You've done that with Bob, outside, and at the climbing gym earlier. Get that help for the general fitness/strength stuff too. Just having someone/someplace you need to show up for, can help.Besides that? Yeah, anything at all is better than nothing whatsoever, and, that anything at all will be more likely to happen if you enjoy it. Classes, that coach, anything. Keep trying new stuff, too! You are/were a dancer, right? Lots of options there! I'd guess that a part of you might find joy there, too?

Helen, thank you for your kind words.  Just about the time I think we are done with things to talk about... absolutely not.  This convo has helped me reframe my query to:  "What do you want?"  I'm not so much sad about turning 70, I just want to be clear on what I want (and whether it is still reasonable.) I was prepared to say this summer, maybe it's over.  Maybe I don't want to climb anymore.  I realize things could change at any time, but after so much roaming and inspecting, I DO want to climb.  Maybe it's the dumb luck of having insulin-dependent diabetes, and a few other things, but I am very aware of choices.  I can't drink margaritas AND climb Ryan's Mountain the following morning.  I better get some pulldown strength, or forget about those hard routes.   There's nothing wrong with just passing on the whole thing... or 'sorta' having fun out there now and then and debauching away.   .  You and I both had the experience of waiting, waiting, waiting and giving... putting the larger desires on the backburner until someday.  Well... someday is here!     Unfortunately, it has a date stamp.  This window of opportunity will be o.v.e.r. soon.  I am in awe of those here who have done their climbing and had their adventures for decades, and are peaceful about cruising for awhile.    :-) But for me, no debauchery (or very little) for now and no excuses.  One up side of coming to the game so late is I have no injuries, no worn out body, no aches or pains... sort of a virgin body.  But it seems to require more care and maintenance to go hard.  Another up side of choosing to continue on is this:You may recall my favorite book, Helen, in which the choices are spelled out:  let it all go to hell, and fall apart slowly over time.  Or get busy, do what you can to stay healthy, and hopefully live an incredible life until death.  "If you haven't been there, you cannot imagine how important the difference is between either of these two curves because you can't imagine how bad 'normal aging' is in this country. Take it on faith for a minute: normal aging is pretty grim, and the difference between the curves is profound."BTW... the new Netflix series on Blue Zones is incredible.   netflix.com/title/81214929---------------VERY unpleasant news:   kesq.com/news/2023/09/13/on…

Lori, about the emotions at your hearing. All those cases of domestic abuse that you sat through—most of those people loved each other—at least at some point—and many still do( or think they do) despite the abuse. That’s why so many abusers are allowed to return—too often with tragic results ( I spent a good amount of my career dealing with such cases)—-life and love are very complicated!!! Still you are dealing with a neighbor with a serious addiction to a very dangerous drug, who can quickly get out-of-control when under the influence, despite how nice and loving he is when sober. You did the right thing.

If there is anything I want my DPT students to get out of my courses it’s that we have to load our older adult patients sufficiently to get benefits. We tend to underload and treat older adults with kid gloves - you have to be working higher loads and lower reps to get muscle strength gains. I like to use ‘1-2 reps left in the tank’ since I don’t usually do 1RM testing. Select a weight that you can get 6-8 good reps with but no more. Rest periods between sets are also important - 2-3 minutes should be required if you are lifting hard enough for strength. 30 seconds if you are lifting for endurance (12+ reps, lighter loads <70% 1RM). Choose multi joint exercises if possible - Rich listed some excellent ones. I try to include a push, pull, press and hinge (squat, roman deadlift) in every program. Avoid single joint exercises (millions of bicep curls etc) - not as functional and time consuming, unless you are rehabbing a specific joint. Above all else - if you haven’t lifted before, get guidance from a professional (per Helen’s comment). It’s pretty stupid to get hurt in the weight room when your goal is to get strong and avoid injury. I have become more and more convinced that resistance training is the single most important thing we can do to promote healthy aging. There are so many benefits.

My go-to workout the past few months has included back squats, deadlifts, bent-over rows, lunges, bench press, step-ups, upright rows and overhead press. With some body weight core + medicine ball work and light plyometrics thrown in as well. That gives a pretty comprehensive full body workout. I do 4-5 sets of 8 reps, 60 sec rest in between sets (working hypertrophy) and it takes about an hour. Muscle soreness is the BEST. Dealing with some health stuff right now, so not able to do much.

There are so many benefits. Wow... thank you, Erika!  I read this on the treadmill at the gym   and it is exactly what I was looking for.  And, as you said, Rich's suggestions fulfill the program...  but I sure with I had a little notebook with pictures and frequencies of a typical resistance program.  I mean... the below is kind of difficult to translate into a workout program.  :-) "A properly designed resistance training program for older adults should include an individualized, periodized approach working toward 2–3 sets of 1–2 multijoint exercises per major muscle group, achieving intensities of 70–85% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), 2–3 times per week, including power exercises performed at higher velocities in concentric movements with moderate intensities (i.e., 40–60% of 1RM)"Things that jumped off the page for me:  * Loss of muscle mass is not the same as loss of muscle strength.   "The rate of decline in muscle strength with age is 2–5 times greater than declines in muscle size."  * I'd like to understand the difference between 'power' and 'strength'... it does seem especially important in climbing.  "Declines in muscle power have been shown to be more important than muscle strength in the ability to perform daily activities." "These adaptations translate to functional improvements of daily living activities, especially when power training exercise is included."  What are power training exercises? * So there's the protein issue again.  I'm wondering if this is the basis for the recommendation of increased protein for people over 65?  "Age-related changes in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function may be attributable to a variety of mechanisms, including disuse, impaired protein synthesis, and chronic inflammation. In regard to muscle disuse, individuals who are physically inactive have been found to have double the risk of future mobility limitation compared with those who meet the US Surgeon General’s recommendations for physical activity (634). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated impaired protein synthesis and decreased muscle anabolism with aging (145,247,253,325,511,628,640). Declines in protein synthesis impair muscle contractile function, strength, and protein quality (26,123,253). *And what about testosterone, estrogen and HGH to help with protein synthesis.  Wouldn't maintaining adequate levels of endocrine hormones make this whole job easier? * I remember my doctor, early on in my T1Diabetes diagnosis saying "You are in catabolic state, and it's our goal to put you into an anabolic state."  ".Moreover, resistance exercise may improve metabolic capacity of skeletal muscle by improving glucose homeostasis, preventing intramuscular lipid accumulation, increasing oxidative and glycolytic enzyme capacity, enhancing amino acid uptake and protein synthesis, and shifting the anabolic/catabolic milieu toward anabolism through release."----------What I'm really thinking about is motivation. I spent 7 years in the gym, 5 days a week, because it was 'good for me' and the only thing available in the city.  But I could never make myself workout and enjoy it.  This last outing with Bob gave me a lot to think about.  Being exhausted from a few hours of climbing, ready to go home, but seeing this one last very difficult route, woke me up and made me want to get on it.  Those love-signals--getting lit up by a route or mountain--brings forward something special.  I think this may be the magic of rock climbing--the inspiration, desire.  I have fallen in love with routes that inspired me to keep working at strength and technique so I could climb them.  I'd like to know more about power.  Is it when you are on a route, and you need to summon some explosive move to get to the next hold?  (and this is usually where I fail).  Is it the 'dyno'?  I was at the gym this morning and wandering around, looking at a hundred different weight machines, and not trusting the 20-something staff guys to be my 'trainer'... I have to figure this out on my own.  EDIT: I missed your last post, Erika.  I hope you get through this soon!  Patience is so hard.      Your words some months ago gave me a lot of hope.  I'm still learning the new rules for my new body... but it's coming along.  I know you will do likewise.  We are all here for you.

Lori - I love how passionate you are about all of this!! Power is the rate of performing work, so it is that explosiveness. Power exercises using weights are not recommended until you have sufficient skill and strength - they are usually the Olympic style lifts (clean, snatch, etc). But there are other ways to work on power - plyometrics are really goodCan I ask why you don’t trust the young staff at the gym to work with you? Check credentials for sure - if they have a strength/conditioning credential (CSCS) they should be very knowledgeable. You definitely don’t need 5 days a week in the gym - in fact you need more recovery than that if you’re training hard enough. 2-3 days/week is plenty. Thanks for the well wishes!

One thing that seems to be missing in training for older people is the power aspect (strength X speed).  Older people lose fast twich fibers much more rapidly than slow twitch.  Apparently, much of the propensity to fall in older people is due to the lack of fast twitch fibers that don’t allow a quick reaction to a small stumble.  While power training is potentially more injurious, I think that it is very important to do some to try to keep your fast twitch fibers.  That is why I always boulder in the gym at least once a week year-round, and I’ve recently added a few sets of campus ladders at the end of each session.  Fortunately, I almost never get injured, so I’m lucky in that regard.

I would second Phylp's post about pecs.  A BIG surprise for me was how lopsided climbing (especially gym climbing) worked my body... I developed very impressive lats and back muscles, and a caved in chest and weak core.  I started looking like an elderly woman developing hunch back.  Whatever I do, I have to give focus to my front.  ------------Maybe it will all make sense to me as I go along.  While I was still working, and really at the top of my game, I took numerous cognitive tests, memory tests, agility tests, annually.  I took them all again for the first time in 3 years last week.  The results were kind of a surprise... I'm faster, sharper, my memory is 50% better than it was 10 years ago.  I really credit climbing.  Even a slow climber (like me) has to make fast decisions while climbing... has to catch a fall quickly, has to find and execute decisions on rock, multi-task... and oh my gosh... memorize sequences, which was always my downfall. Even learning navigation, intuitively knowing directions and where the sun is, scrambling and staying out of chasms... being outdoors teaches you so much! I wish I had been able to raise my kids this way. This climbing thing is pretty miraculous.  :-)

Several very different discussions going on simultaneously right now—which is fun!!!Gabe, Crow Hill is not gritstone. Maybe is once was but that would have been several geologic ages ago. Grit is sedimentary—basically a crystalline sandstone. Crow is metamorphic—rock altered from its original state by heat and/or pressure. Several areas in the US, such as Coopers Rock, WVA and other nearby areas and southern Illinois areas, such as Jackson Falls, are often considered to be grit, but still don’t have the exact characteristics.

Back in the 70s, when gritstone climbing was very ‘glamorous’—thanks to Mountain Magazine, Crow and a number of other areas were frequently called ‘gritstone-like’ —but, while there are similarities with grit, it is, in fact, the metamorphic rock gneiss, not the sedimentary rock—gritstone. My late English friend, Dave, who lived on the edge of the Derbyshire moors, just a few miles from Stanage and other of the famous gritstone edges, was very emphatic that neither our western MA gneiss nor even the West VA sandstone at the New or even Coopers were gritstone.

Just got back from ten days at City of Rocks; spent the last half-hour catching up on the Over 50 saga.I had a great time (as usual). Only got seven new routes but did a bunch of quality repeats. The only disappointment was not having Helen there for entertainment.Working out at our local (non-climbing) gym during July and August seems to have had some measure of help. Nothing too dramatic, but noticeable. Pushing, pulling, pressing, and hinging appear to be a pretty good recipe. Looking forward to getting back to it after recovery from the travelling. You're welcome to join me, Lori. Prime-time Joshua Tree season is getting close. I have a trip to Bishop planned for later in October. Can't wait!

Could there be a nicer person in the world than Peter Croft?  I’ve listened to, and watched interviews with Peter and he just seems like the most genuine, lovely man who also happens to be one of the best climbers ever. If I have any hero worship, he would be it. I just know that if I showed up in Bishop and asked him to Guide me for the day he would be as respectful and supportive of my journey as he would with a professional climber. What a wonderful guy.I’m not sure if this is Peter on EBGBS, but I think it is, and suddenly I cannot find Bob’s picture of Peter on Figures, but his movement on rock is pure grace. In his interview Peter talked about climbing volume which I know we’ve talked about here and of being more than ready to tackle your chosen routes.  He said he soloed some 511 pitches the morning that he climbed Astroman, and so I guess he meant it very seriously.  This is a little depressing for me because there are limits to what I’ve got in the tank even after a lot of hiking and scrambling and climbing, easier routes. And. Speaking of hero worship, I heard from my BFF Dave Houser this week and I think he’d be happy to have a chat.  It’s hard to describe why that would mean so much but maybe in part because Dave’s routes were the first I really understood as creation and vision here, and athleticism, and yet Dave himself was so elusive. As time goes oand I count the passing years among the veteran climbers here, it makes me only more determined to talk to them, and somehow leave a little bit for history. Actually, I wish I had followed that instinct and done that with my mother before she died at 102. my kids have  a few memories of her but not her incredible descriptions of the depression and World War II, etc.I think we’ll regret it if we don’t get these histories of various climbers captured. I know a lot has already been written, but just thinking about myself and how much effort it has taken to get the backstory for instance on a Charles Cole or even John Bachar… it sure can’t hurt to get what we can.it’s a beautiful morning here and I wanted to get some exercise so I gave myself the option of hiking up Ryans , where there are no rattlesnakes and no mosquitoes or heading up to the Buttress, where there’s nothing but mosquitoes and probably rattlesnakes so the buttress it was! I’ve been miserable with dozens and dozens of bites over the last few weeks but hopefully they’ll go away soon.

And the result is less than stellar posts, spelling and grammar-wise.I know your spelling is excellent, and you’ve corrected mine a time or two and maybe we come from the same generation where this was so important. I was thinking about this this morning because so much of my communication with my best friend is by text and I spent so much time correcting errors and making sure that all the tenses are correct, etc. Lately I have been saying to heck with it.  If she can understand it it’s good enough. But my damn phone capitalizes the most bizarre things and puts punctuation wherever it pleases.With regards to Peter maybe he didn’t climb 511 routes before he headed up Astroman.   But it’s a nice thought.

Currently she’s chewing up my favorite blanket. She has sniffed every part of my body and seems to have a fascination for my insulin so maybe she could be a diabetes dog. She doesn’t have paws – – she has hooves.She does not come when called and when I take her outside, she has no idea what to do on a leash, and when I let her off the leash, she tears around the yard and refuses to come back.  “catch me if you can.”When Tony drives we listen to his 50s and 60s music. Does anyone remember that old song Walk Like A Man?  What a great name for a route.Actually, my list of names for new routes is growing and I wish Joshua Tree was virgin territory because I’d be naming everything in sight.

Most of us climbers who train follow the same schedule week to week.  Most experts would recommend training hard  for three or four weeks, then having a de-load week where you keep the intensity up but greatly decrease the volume.  For older climbers, this might be more like two hard weeks then one de-load week.  So maybe Mike you could train two or even three days a week for a couple of weeks, then a week with only one (shorter) session.   Of course if you are climbing/bouldering a lot than one day per week may be plenty.

Our dog is a rescue. We are guessing that she was abused by a male, likely one with a moustache, because initially she was very skittish, even somewhat hostile, around me and most other guys, but bonded quickly with my daughter ( who initially rescued her) and wife. As Kristian said, it took her almost a year to really ‘accept’ me and realize that I wasn’t going to hurt her. Now we’re great friends!!!

It’s a tough call, but I think this puppy is not for us. She’s truly delightful and effusive and has boundless energy. I don’t think she’s been abused because she’s just so happy and I think she would make a great family pet for a younger couple with kids. But Tony is already miserable with allergies from her and had to take some anti-histamines today. He’s feeling terrible that he’s not mobile enough to help me with this dog.  It would be all me on this one.But she is so inquisitive and she seems to head straight for all the things she shouldn’t have. Tony has his prized $.99 Walmart shopping bag and she’s smitten by it and has pulled it off the chair and the table a dozen times. Finally, he just donated it to her.   She also loves magazines and has chewed up several before I could get them away. The little P pad that you put down for accidents? She loves those. She rips them to shreds and throws them in the air. She’s really delightful.I keep thinking about my last little rescue, Poppy, who was blind, deaf , and incontinent , and had been really hurt in her life. It was a last minute rescue, arranged by my daughter.  I kept Poppy for the next five years and I did my best with her, but it was never love. I just wasn’t ready for a dog that needed so much and I hated myself for not loving her more. Oddly, I miss her the most out of all my pets. But I don’t want another Poppy situation where we make the best of something that just won’t work. I knew it might take several tries to find the right little friend for us. I hate to see this dog go back to the adoption agency, but I know she was treated well there. Maybe I can try to help them find her the right home. Kind of sad tonight.

We always had boxers when I was growing up, which are generally excellent guard dogs. The short hair is easier to manage with cleanup but they still shed quite a bit. If you are highly allergic (as I am) it’s a constant battle). you could just get a motion activated barking dog recording.

my bias as a veterinarian:replace "i rescued," with,  "i adopted." if you got the pet from a shelter you didn't do the rescuing, they did. if i had a dollar for everytime i heard "he's just a rescue," as justification for not taking proper care of a sick pet, I'd have a few thousand extra."my dog was abused." maybe it was. more likely its just timid and by trying to soothe them out of their timidness you are just reinforcing it.

Plus, had appointments and obligations.I did, however, get to have early dinner with John and Jean a few days ago! A stop in Boise on their way to the north. That was great!I'll be at COR in June 2024. Sites are booking now, and man, the place is filling up fast! The pandemic did us no favors, with people suddenly deciding camping's the bomb, and discovering City is great. Plus, the million or so people moving to Idaho/Utah. Sheesh.Hoping to get hands on rock this week, but not holding my breath. One partner is on the injured list, and the other is on a daytime sleep schedule. Oh well. Maybe it's time to dig the spuds??

Looks like chalk on the right side!Euthanasia. tough topic. Google "compassion fatigue, veterinarian and suicide."I perform the service about 3 to 5 times per week. Every time its emotionally difficult. The only time I actually sobbed was a 1 year old Great Dane that was physically healthy but aggressive. It was the guys third home after biting multiple people. These owners rescued it from euthanasia and went to UC Davis for behavior training after other trainers failed. They couldn't work with the dog. DOg was good with dad but almost bit mom. They worked really hard to give this dog a good life and it just wasn't happening.In general I support euthanasia, whole heartedly, as the last gift we give our pets. When it gets hard is when a treatable disease is declined by the owner and it becomes a find a home or let it suffer until it dies at home. "Suffer" is an interesting choice of words we use for pets with chronic disease and not one I tend to use. Suffering for a human involves the idea that we are going to have this chronic pain or health problem for a long time. We don't believe dogs and cats experience this type of suffering. We believe dogs and cats live for the here and now and if that sucks then euthanasia is a great option to end that pain. 25% of all dog and cat owners choose euthanasia for example when diabetes is diagnosed as they just can't handle the twice a day injections--sometimes the animals can't handle it either. I remember you asking about Poppy a few years ago. I remember a couple posters being critical of your choice. I was new to this forum and I apologize that I didn't chime in supporting you. To me, it made perfect sense. I hope that you are good with your choice.

that doc did not even xray the ankle or foot that was broken, didn't believe my friend when he said he fell 80ft. when I retrieved his rope I measured it and it was 100ft fall..   My friend was in enough shock that he was not able to self diagnose after his fall and self rescue.

Their main concern is are you going to die from a brain bleed, did you damage your spinal cord, did you rupture any internal vital organs or arteries. He probably had a dozen different xrays and cat scans.And from the injured persons point of view, there so much full body pain and shock going on, you can actually miss one focal area of pain. I took a 15-20 foot groundfall once that injured both ankles, one hand, soft tissue trauma to butt - and it was 5 days before I realized I had also smashed my tailbone. Because I was in so much other pain and had been lying in bed or reclining on a couch for 5 days and had never had direct touch on it.He may indeed not be the world's best doc but ERs are nonstop madhouses.

Up where Nick lives and these accidents happened, it is indeed very likely that this MD is the ‘only show in town’. But, Phyl is correct ( as usual) that it is often the case with such accidents ( same with car crashes, etc) the initial triage focus is on the major, potentially life-threatening injuries, and as a result some other damage is initially overlooked.

No cat scan just an x ray of his knee because it looked the nastiest. Northern is right on the Canadian border and likely under staffed. When I fell off a ladder and ended up in Dartmouth they kept me for 8 hrs and did cat scan, ultrasound etc etc. They scheduled a follow up before I was released.  Northern is simply pathetic. All the hospitals up here if you don't hound them nothing happens. I had a biopsy a month ago and still haven't seen results.

I had a biopsy a month ago and still haven't seen results.Nick, I've been reading along about your friend.  So sorry this happened, and that medical care is not close to adequate.  But thank goodness he's alive.  That was a heck of a long fall.  I know back country doctors are not the best, usually... but our doctors here are not great either.  I no longer blame them, I think we must be undergoing a big shift in medicine.  I KNOW my doctors want to heal patients, want to do their best... but with an overwhelming caseload, and such limited time and focus, they can only do the minimum.  It just helps to know this going in.  Tony stayed with Eisenhower, our local and best PPO network, and in the last six months has gone through 4 Primary physicians.  They just quit.  I believe we have to advocate for ourselves, big time... and let them know exactly what we want/need from them.  Of course, that has nothing to do with a life/death emergency where everyone should be on the same page.  ------I've been pretty sick the last few days, and I'm wondering if it could be West Nile Virus, or maybe just a reaction to dozens of mosquito bites. A friend warned me about WNV and I thought he was being paranoid.  Especially here in the desert, where would an infected mosquito come from?  But I was wrong... there are many cases currently in San Bernardino County, and the entire southland. On 3 different outings I must have been bitten a total of 40 times.  Today I'm almost too wiped out to move.  Yesterday, sweats and nausea all day. We decided to give our new puppy a few more days before making final decision.  She is a handful!!!  Her new favorite trick is to race through the house first thing in the morning... go crashing into walls, skid to a halt, do it all again... and then sneak up on me when I'm making coffee and yank on my pajama shorts... and pull.  She loves dead birds and tennis shoes.  She knows her name now (Issa), does come when called, and loves to go outside... but not alone.  My favorite thing is the 'head tilt'.  I believe she will calm down in time, if we keep her.  She so far has no idea when and where to poop and pee... this doesn't sit well with Tony.  She goes outside, finds a spot to poop and squat... then dashes inside and does it all again on the floor.  So, I'm hoping that she will catch on soon. I guess if we keep her even a few more days I will get the book Kris recommended and see what we need to do.  I mean, with a 9 month old dog, I know she can be trained exactly how we want.  Todd... does this look like a St. Bernard to you?  No one really knows.  I see lab.  And maybe border collie.  It would sure be nice to know before she grows into a horse.

Lori,Your new dog will calm down. I got a one-year old kelpie about a year and a half ago. Chewed multiple pieces of furniture and is aggressive with other dogs. Now, after a year and a half, her furniture-chewing is greatly diminished. She doesn't torment (plays too rough) my older dog as much. It takes time and patience. And a lot of stern "No"s. You will come to love your new doggie and she will love you. Don't bail on her!

As for Frank's prediction that your dog will calm down: yes, but perhaps not nearly as soon as you like. Our Heeler mix (a notoriously devilish breed) takes me on a two mile walk twice a day, almost every day. On the days when I miss even one of those walks, she finds a way to burn off excess energy in the house, usually right before I'm ready to go to bed. She's one and a half now, and we're looking forward to the day when she grows up enough to calm down a bit.

Hi all, I haven’t posted in quite a while, so I thought I ought to update y’all on my recovery. I apologize for the major non-sequitor. Late last summer, I was struck by a rock while belaying, and got a fractured femur. I talked some about it when it happened.Due to the absolute miracle of modern medicine, I was able to “touch down” my broken leg right after my surgery, and was weight bearing at 2 weeks. Because of all the internal titanium, no cast was needed. I started PT at about 8 weeks. A certain amount of violence was done to my knee by the surgery, so the focus of my early PT was to regain range of motion. Initially, I was at 90 degrees. I took myself back into the climbing gym at 10 weeks, and simply climbed around my limitations. Those first few sessions were kind of cool because I could tell the difference between 5.5 and 5.6. Also, pro tip, if your footwork sucks, you build upper body strength.Anyway, after the new year, I started with a PT group that focused on athlete recovery. It’s been twice a week since January. I’ve learned a lot of exercises that I’d never done before, including free weights and kettle bells. My severely atrophied left quadriceps are pretty much back; it’s taken many months of work. Unfortunately, over all that time and effort, I still couldn’t walk comfortably. After a mile of so, it would get super painful. Weirdly, gym climbing was maybe even better than before. Not being able to walk was very disheartening, not only for me, but for my spouse, There were so many things that were off the table. But I also realized that my adapted life wasn’t horrible, just different. Hopefully, there are lessons there. If I‘m subject to a life change with no hope of recovery, I would hope for equanimity, and find a good life with the tools I have.Luckily, my PT is smart, and he felt that there were issues with the hardware in my leg. My doctor concurred. It turned out that one of the screws securing the titanium rod was interfering with my IT band. It was removed 2 weeks ago, and i was immediately “cured”. In the blink of an eye (thank you anesthesia), I could walk normally with zero pain. I still have a bit of PT to do for full recovery, but it definitely seems that I will be back to my old self.This was my first real injury, after a lifetime outdoors. While I probably would be happier if it hadn’t happened, I think I’m humbler and more grateful for what I CAN do. And I‘ve been more willing to try hard and fail. About a month ago, I put myself on a 5.13 in the gym. Prior to my injury, I was too worked up about whatever to even try (“that’s WAY above my pay grade!”). Now, it’s “hmm, let’s see how it goes.” BTW, it’s still above my pay grade, but not so far above it.I’m already looking forward to COR in 2024! Now, if I can only do the opening rock-over on Redtail…

Victor, what an inspiration you are! You’ve worked through some hard times and it looks like it’s paying off. Thanks for the great update.——I know this is not a dog thread and I am sorry for all the posts but I’m a little overwhelmed. Maybe someone will have a thought. I’m waiting for the book that Kris recommended to arrive.  Our puppy, Issa… I think she’s just about perfect but at nine months old she has no idea about potty training so she has pooped throughout the house and Peed everywhere. I cleaned at least six piles of poop yesterday and mopped up endless puddles. I am taking her outside on the hour, and she runs and plays and even pees outside, but then comes in the house, and does it again. I have put pee-pads on the floor and she likes to pick those up and shred them eat the little bits so she doesn’t get what those are for. Tony and I rarely argue or disagree and this is not where I want to have a battle, but he sees it as defiance and that’s ridiculous.  I can’t think of the last time I had a dog this young so if I can’t figure something out in the next few days, maybe I can get a trainer. She is already such an effusive and happy puppy, and she just loves to be close. She really doesn’t want to be around Tony because he’s pretty gruff. I hope we can get this worked out sooner than later.

Lori,I have house trained my dogs using the old-fashioned way: if they go to the bathroom in the house, I hold their face to the offending material (don't actually push the face into it), say "no," then take her/him outside for a couple of minutes.All training must be timely. You can't admonish the dog if they misbehaved 5 or 10 minutes ago.When you're housetraining the dog, you have to always have him in your sight; he can't just roam where you're not watching.There is also "crate-training," but you can look that up. Personally, I don't like keeping a dog cooped up in a crate, but it works for many people.House training takes work and time, so you have to put some effort into it. It only takes a few days or weeks, but it pays off.Sounds like you've never had a puppy before.Start training now - you shouldn't have to hire someone to do this for you.

The mountain weather is settled into “Raisin Season” - that time of year when the Fresno Farmers feel confident enough to pick grapes and lay them on the ground for two weeks- if it rains they loose everything. The hi alpine stone is all washed off, Sierra Ice is forming up and you can go for it with a light pack. The cold nites kills the bugs. Lori… Nice Dog! Good for you for saving her. Young pups can be a struggle, especially when they have been tossed into the cage at the pound/“shelter”. She never learned potty training, cause she wasn’t with Mom long enough to learn that. You need to become her Mom and teach her acceptable behavior. Dogs are only looking to fit in to a pack with a strong Alpha dog (that’s you) leading the way. (Franks advice was spot on) A young dog has to get that energy out- you can’t do it on a leash. Is there a Dog Park in JT, 29 stumps or Yucca? If so use it! Out of control running is the prescription to calm that girl down for a few hours. Watch “dog whisper” on YouTube. Cesar knows the good tricks. I have had great Dalmatians before- two of them that were well trained. So well trained in fact that I would take them into “JT” with no leash. Got caught a few times, two short whistles, and they would come sit by my legs. Impressed the Rangers so much they just walked away with no ticket. Take care of that dog now and she will take care of you for a long time! Luck to you. ————————————————————Carl- why such boring attire at “the comp” I figured you would be wearing extra loud tights with no shirt and a Cowboy hat! Any way props to you for trying!

You gotta walk the neighborhood with the dog, taking it "out" is not what the dog wants, it most certainly wants to walk the neighborhood and poop somewhere else besides the living room floor.

I saw this post by Todd Gordon this morning on Facebook and thought, of course! This place is endless. As much as I have hiked and explored, I haven’t even begun to cover 1/10th of it.I was out hiking yesterday, and heard footsteps behind me, and was so startled for a moment I was actually afraid. I turned around to meet a young guy in a bright yellow T-shirt and we struck up a conversation. he’s from orange county and took a week off to camp out here alone. I’m sure there’s a story there. I meet people all the time who just come here to get their heads together, or heal from a broken heart, or make big career changes. We joked a little because he said he was a climber but now he mostly mountain bikes. Turns out he was a boulderer and it was hurting his wrists too much , so we discussed the possibility of climbing some of these magnificent routes on a rope.It kind of blows my mind that I can walk by the same rock formations 100 times and suddenly discover something new. One something new that is not new at all is this rock in real hidden Valley. But now I’m getting picky and if it looks like too much bother to hike up to, I put it off till tomorrow. (Something about an elephant)Guy, you always save the day with your encouraging and supportive words. Thank you so much. This dog is a total doofus. She loves to race and careen into things. She’ll charge across our patio to chase a ball and then come to a screeching halt and bang her nose, and then bring the ball back to do it again.I am amazed at how fast she’s learning. A very quiet no will make her stop. She really wants to please. she doesn’t want to go in her crate as much but she does like her treats so it’s a fair exchange until she gets this potty training worked out. She loves her pink eight dollar Walmart, blanket and any toy or ball that squeaks.Both Tony and I have a lot to learn. I like rough-housing with her and playing with her toys, but she still learning how not to hurt me. If we get too carried away, she’ll miss and nip me. And then I know she feels bad. We do need an adult in the room and I’m not sure I am the adult!   There are a few dog parks locally, but I don’t know what that really means. If it means bring your dog on a leash and make her play nicely, I don’t think we’re ready for that. But we have a half-acre lot and there is a whole lot of room to run hard, my only concern is there are goats heads everywhere and if she gets them stuck in her paws that won’t be so fun. I had kind of been hoping for a basset hound.

Lori- Morning. Frantically packing now to go north. Just to add about dogs. MM is quite correct about the walk around the block, you might have a large lot, but a dog wants to know what is around their territory and mark that territory with some poo and pee. The dog park is so your dog can begin to socialize with other dogs and run free and fast for a while. This is the way to have a good dog- do this everyday and I guarantee it will work. And dog parks are fun for the people too.My Dalmatians were great dogs -if I could run them everyday for 45 minutes minimum. A 12 mile mountain bike ride up behind my home did the trick. This is the secret to good dog behavior. Sounds like your pup will respond, try it. Happy Climbing

For Colden.    EDIT: I wanted to add a mention of the farmstand. When all else fails, you can sure grow a crop indoors on this. I bought it a couple of years ago and it was pricey, but after that initial investment, it requires very little. I don’t know if we have a season here for lettuces and most herbs but I can grow all that year round on the Farmstand . Right now I have six different kinds of lettuce, bok choi, strawberries, cherry, tomatoes, basil, and thyme, marigolds and zinnias… and plenty of everything for large salads or stirfry every day.

Wow Lori, you're garden looks great! Do you have to buy starts from them? Use your own seeds? How does it work? I assume hydroponic, and needs a nutrient solution added now and then?I'm also assuming you meant cherry tomatoes. If you're getting cherries off of that thing, well, I'm seriously impressed!So, I walked/ran my second 5k today. Did way better than I expected! Goal was simply to do the thing. Beyond that, try to run at least some. Then, it became little things, like stay ahead of the pink flamingo girls and the bridal gowns ladies. Try to catch up with those pinwheel hats up there ...   Now it's sit under Catcat, suck up some coffee, and enjoy a pumpkin scone from the market. That was today too. Then?It's time to pick storage crops. And....Just might be digging the spuds this week. Yes, it's exciting. Yes, I am a VERY cheap date.Best, Helen

Lori Milas wrote:Hey Helen!  That tank holds 15 gallons of water and it’s easier if you order the starts right off the website but you can certainly use your own seeds. You add a couple different nutrients to the water and keep an eye on the pH. I did find that I had much better results if I took the time to use reverse osmosis water. It could be our desert water here is just the wrong kind and my tank would grow green stuff and everything would die spontaneously with water from the hose. I just wanted to see color in the house and see if I could grow a few flowers to add to the salads. So, if you don’t have a desperate need to hoe and weed, this is a way to go.——We had a little setback here with our puppy, and it cost me a night of sleep, but it cost Tony more. In the process of getting her leash somehow his hand got caught up in the leash and she freaked and clamped down hard, and when I came running in his hand was literally wrapped in her leash, and her jaw, and both were desperate to get loose. Then I added to the mess by trying to pry her jaw open and I got bit quite a few times. I finally cut her leash off—both were then free—and the whole scene was a bloody mass. The following morning Tony went to the ER and his hand is as big as a baseball, and he needed  X-rays and quite a bit of triage on that hand. When he came home, the first thing he said was “this was not the dogs fault. She didn’t do anything wrong“. And I could tell she felt terrible—we all felt terrible, but learned a good lesson even about playtime.  Even when she’s grabbing her toy or her blanket She’s learning how to judge distance so as not to accidentally bite me but she is a puppy so we will have to be really careful. This is a chewing dog. She has been all day working on a rawhide bone. She’s pulled the stuffing out of her favorite toy after hours of diligent hard work and pulled the eyeballs off. I don’t think she has a bone of aggression in her, she is nothing but kindness. Except for the eyeballs I guess. —-I’ve done a lot of thinking this summer about climbing and what I hope to gain this coming year aside from climbing itself. 10,000 posts ago rgold helped me make peace with not leading and I’ve never looked back. However, I want to feel like I can take care of myself and not feel so totally dependent so I’ve kind of cooked up a wish list. I realized how much I need this when Nelson and I went back to climb Good to the last Drop a second time. It’s a little scramble to get to a ledge at the base of the route and probably best to do on a short rope just to be safe. But when I got to that ledge, which hovers probably 40 feet over a drop off chasm, I suddenly felt panicky, because I was having an impending low blood sugar but also because Nelson said “stay right here while I walk up to the top and set up a top rope and Ill drop a rope in about 30 minutes “. And I looked around and realized that I have no idea how to get down if I needed to and really not the skills even to build a little anchor and rap off if I needed to. Just knowing that I could do that and had done it before would have given me the confidence to feel comfortable on that ledge . So this year I hope that I can learn and practice some self rescue techniques and maybe see if I feel like doing more from there.This morning I was having fun looking at beautiful rocks I will never climb.Hey, thanks for the info, Lori! Could be a plus, in the winter?Re the pup?Multiple hand bites, isn't "a little setback". Sure, maybe panic by the pup, but still....My two cents?If you are intending to keep her (and it sounds like it's too late for Tony, no going back on her now??), hire a professional. Now, not later. Start serious training, get good advice on what to do, what not to do, heck, it might even help if she was in a different collar/harness. There's lots of ways to do things, the right professional might be a huge, huge, help! Where would your climbing be, without the people you hired to help you? Yeah, maybe you'd be where you are now....but maybe not. There's only so much time available to do stuff, we all know that, so....we need to pick what we can waste time doing on our own, or, what should just be turned over to people who can do a far better job of it, and faster. Plus, you guys get to learn, fast, without dangerous trial and error. On the home front, here?Old lady knees are definitely aware she did sumthin today. Tomorrow I might be fossilized, lol!H.EDIT to add:Tomatoes for dinner, Thai peppers for future seed stock. One fruit picked off each plant. Dry, and set aside somewhere. When I need to grow them out again in 5ish years? I'll get 2 seeds per pod, and get starts going. There's an ample overabundance out there, these beautiful little plants just crank these out, and I only need 1 or 2 peppers per stir fry, so.....once picked and dried, I'll have I dunno how many quart jars of these. It's the only way, though. Grow them, save seeds myself....or live without. If anyone of you hotheads wants some, just let me know, eh?Hey, Lori, and I do hope Tony's hand, and your nips heal up with no difficulties! Got bit to the bone by cats a couple times over the years. Rescued half to almost feral kittens. Lap cats, every one of them....but it took some time for the wildest/most scared ones.

I’m feeling very unmotivated to climb at all. I’ve only climbed once during the past week. Lori, you should learn how to build a trad anchor. It’s not too difficult it’s fun to learn and as you found it can be useful if things go wrong.

Thank you, Helen. I was heading right back to delete that post because I realize there was no way to describe that scene fairly. This puppy did not bite anyone and if she had unfortunately we would have to not keep her. We just can’t have a biting dog, especially if it were in the first week of fostering. She somehow got her soft fabric collar twisted tight around Tony‘s hand and neither could get loose and she couldn’t breathe so she was just frantically trying to get her self free. She now has a harness until we can get some professional advice and training. The harness is very loose and she’s fine with it  And training was always on the agenda, in fact mandatory.Oh God… Yes, exactly like Bob. Who needs Bob? I could have figured this all out on my own!   Thank you Carl. One of the considerations I have had about taking time to learn anchor building is that I would need to commit to reviewing it frequently. I have taken anchor- building classes and I’ve built plenty of anchors as a practice but if I haven’t done it in a year it’s all lost on me. so I guess it truly is use it or lose it.  SO glad you are pulling out of your funk!!!

I’m just catching up on the thread. You should definitely take obedience classes - you need to be trained as much as she does! I’ve had dogs my entire life abd I still go through obedience school with every new pup. Always learn more stuff for me - and every pup is different. It really is more about training us than them though…. We do a lot of things that create unwanted behaviors without realizing it. Work now will pay off tremendously later. Good luck - she sure is cute!

I had a really nice morning out with Bob. Even though it was cool, and mostly in the shade, I came home with a sunburn. I’m still trying to figure out what I have gained or lost from last year—it’s a little discouraging because right now a 5.8 is hard. But fun. Maybe that’s just the way it’s going to go!  Tige 5.8 pic by Bob GainesRegarding Issa, we are trying to carefully think this over. She’s so much fun and I believe her heart is in the right place. I just want to do right by this dog and not take on more than we can handle because it would only hurt her.This morning as I was putting my robe to go to the kitchen, she grabbed my robe and played tag with it, managed to grab the belt and pull it off the robe and she just wanted to play. The biggest issue right now is house training and I don’t know enough about this to fix it. She loves to go outside and romp and play but when she comes in the house she immediately pees and poops so she’s got it all backwards. I just got a text from the rescue place that they will throw in some free training at Petco if that’ll tip the scales. I hate playing the age card, but Tony is 74 and I just turned 70 add I have to honestly ask can we give this dog what she needs? The below picture was my son with my granddaughter Gidget and she was an older small dog so it was all so easy and I really loved her. So we could go for a smaller dog or maybe the good Lord brought us this one because she’s right for us. Sort of a “love the one you’re with“ situation?

I appreciate the kudos for climbing a 5.8. It’s a fun route. I was trying to compare the difficulty yesterday from a year prior on the same route. I guess this is my own personal interest – – what happens with aging? Science is giving us a few more answers along the lines of senescent cells, oxidation, loss of horror, moans (ha ha! My iPhone insists on writing the word “hormones” this way), and the blue zone guys are certainly studying the areas of the world where people live to be 100. Probably social connection and purpose trump the right food, but they are all important.In my studious notetaking, I have made the direct connection between protein intake the day before, during and the day after climbing and my own strength and endurance and recoveryI would say hydration and electrolytes are a close second. So I never had to think about that before but it’s critical now.  There’s not even a question in my mind now, except whether I can follow through and do that amount of protein. It’s been exactly 14 months since I suddenly got sick and had no idea what the problem was. It was gradual at first, but then it was like a hammer over my head and throughout the worst winter of my life I just continued losing weight, vitality and hope.  So coming back from that has been an exercise in absolute determination. I am still dealing with some symptoms but I am 80% better. Still, I’d like to see what I can do with this 70th year. I just don’t feel like I have many more years in which I can go all out. So maybe “all out“ is now easier routes, but maybe it’s not, and we’ll see, and I’m keeping good notes.Like Carl, I cannot just throw my hands up in the air and say “oh well”!  I think this is the privilege of you guys who have had amazing years on the rock and feel quite good about cruising. I think all are valid points of view, right? Because I started late, I have no feeling of having been better in the past than I am now. I have no injuries, I’m strong, so I am just curious. I am my own petri dish.La Copine 5.9well, it’s time to load up that shotgun and let Tony try to teach me how to fire it. I was too afraid to put a shell in, but I think I’m over it now.

There's a 5.6 locally that, if I hafta stay in reach of the bolts, is a no go. There's also a 5.10 here I thrashed my way through, as a follow...but couldn't reach the anchors. Lots of anchors out there are jussst out of reach, requiring climbing an extra move, climbing beside the anchors, or even above, to clip them. So I don't do that. Usually.What grade could I climb?Dunno. Don't care.See, I can always toss out that I've been ice climbing, so neener neener to the rest of you, lol.Seriously, though?Yeah, it is different, when you DON'T have that history to look back on. For myself, that means any real physicality at all, that's remotely like athleticism.And suddenly, out of nowhere?Here I am, with a body I never knew does shit like this! Holy crap! What else can it do???!?So I definitely feel a very loud clock ticking, cuz now, right effing now, is IT. THIS is IT. My only shot at whatever this body can do, plus, my real shot at setting myself up for the next decades coming.Staying active, eating reasonably well, pursuing fun, and making and celebrating friendships.Seeing the possibilities and giving it a shot.Best, Helen

So this is a comment/discussion for Brandt, Russ, Randy, CMiller, Bob Gaines etc, Joshua Tree "locals" who still climb at Joshua Tree, and it concerns the general reluctance of people to uprate the ratings on routes in the MP route list - Routes that may actually have gotten significantly harder over time because flakes have come off.Yesterday, Sam and I went out to Hitman cliff.  One of the routes we did was called The Enforcer, rated 5.9.  First done in 1983, the only comments are from Russ and Susan back in 2007.  Russ called it 10a 16 years ago.  Yesterday, Sam led, I followed.  At my height, the first 10-15' feet, if no one had told me a rating, I would have called 10c/d.  Once you can reach the rounded grip on the right below the mini-bulge, it gets 5.9.  But getting to that is hard. A strenuous armbar to gain height. I didn't want to work that hard so early in the day, so after a couple of tries, I yarded up on the rope. My guess is that when the route was first done, there were a few flakes on the face on the left or right side that would have helped greatly for that 30 seconds that are needed to get to a better, higher position.  But both those faces are completely smooth now. Those couple of moves were harder than anything on the 10b, The Bruiser, to the right (which Sam onsighted and I followed clean).When I fail on a 5.9, I'm curious why.  Looking deeper in the comments, Matt Hagny (RIP), who wasn't a short guy, commented that he failed in trying to do this route on TR.  Matt was a stronger climber than me. Randy, who is in a position where no one is going to question his assessment, has rated the route 10b.So is this route not 5.9 any more? If so, why haven't people said so? It's natural to wonder if you missed something, if what is needed is a technique you suck at, if you're having a high gravity day, but is it more that people are afraid they are going to be publicly ridiculed if they uprate something? I have a policy to not rate a route unless I've gotten it clean, so I'm not going to suggest a changed rating for this route. But I've seen this in J Tree before on other routes and have commented for those routes.

Phyl, nobody wants to be the wanker suggesting an upgrade. Take the Bastille Crack for example. It was 5.7+ in the earliest guides, and 5.8 in the ‘82 Rossiter guide to Boulder I used whaen I did the route in ‘93. It was slick as snot then, and I certainly thought that 5.8 was reasonable. Although I haven’t been on it since, I don’t think that it became any less polished. However, the consensus grade now is 5.7-, with many suggesting 5.6 and even 5.5.Or, here is another example. My wife has been working a 5.12+ that was on the softer side. A key jug recently broke off, creating a new crux just after the old crux with no rest in between. A guy comes along, tries it for the weekend, can’t link the cruxes, comments on how much harder it is now, and then proceeds to downrate it.

Phylp -You do know that in Joshua Tree the first fifteen feet don't count, right? All joking aside, it would be nice if more people use the rating function to get a better consensus; it seems the majority of people give a star rating without giving it a grade.

5.8 is roughly my max for trad leading because I have a weak, silly head.  My favourite climb at Mt Arapiles is Hell for Leather which is a grade 13 (which I think is about a 5.6).  It's a lovely, well protected route with a number of overhangs which you pull through on jugs. The guide book description starts with the words 'pleasant jug hauling', which, in my opinion, you really can't go past.  Last time I climbed it I quipped 'pleasant jugs all around me, it's like being in a French whorehouse!'.  It may well be the first route I do when I get to Araps this Saturday and in fact I'll hopefully do it a number of times when I'm there.   Sometimes I think my weak, silly head is almost a mental illness, I almost talk myself out of leading as I get so fearful and worried, but that's just who i am and I'm Ok with that.During the gym sesh last night I did well TRing up to grade 21 (5.10c). There were a few older guys there and we were talking about how it's not work pushing one's self at our age as injury could bring the whole thing undone permanently. Lori, as you know, the fact you're still active and climbing at 70 is fucking remarkable.  What's the shot gun for? Did I ever tell you iIused to go rabbit shooting with a AK47?

I think most people feel similarly.  It's only when I think it's at least 2 letter grades off that I'll say something.  If I know it was a solely a height issue that caused the difficulties, I typically only comment about my perceived rating difference in the comments, and not with an official rating.  This is because I don't think it makes any sense to impact the ratings because I personally have a deficit of below average height. But I have both up and down rated a number of routes in cases where I feel comfortable in my assessment.  I think what I was trying to get across in my post is that I think what happens is that people climb something, say to their partner "no f*%king way that is X", and the partner agrees, but, as Frank so eloquently put it, they don't want to be the wanker that says it on the internet.  I think Joshua Tree in particular may intimidate people into being quiet about an opinion in that way.  It certainly is less likely to happen in reporting about more recently developed crags.

As to the ratings thing…. It all boils down to femur length.As to Matt…. He was all over the place with his ratings and by and large had no clue.  His signature move was the lead, fell hung, tick and then down rate the route, skewing the results.  Grades are subjective, duh.  The route you are talking about was rated 5.9.  You are calling it 10 a or b?  That is not much of a reach.  It’s not like a 5.8 that is truly 5.10 or something.  It’s a couple letter grades.  I run into this all the time and sometimes you can hit the moves just right, and sometimes ya don’t.

Phylp, it's my understanding that whoever initially lists the route, sets the rating. The average of rating opinions by other users is supposed to cause the original grade to be potentially modified (up or down). Apparently, not enough opinions of a harder grade have been posted to change it yet?5.9 was the original grade by the FA, though that seems kinda off.

Lori, if you're pooch is in fact a border Collie she is incredibly smart and active. If you don't run her five miles a day things will get a bit interesting.  One of the things we do with Bernie is hit tennis balls for him until he gets completely wiped out.  He recovers quickly and is always ready for another round.

Thank you for your encouraging words Carl. I’ve been a little torn up about this climbing thing lately. At the age of 70 I don’t quite know what it is all about for me. It may be a little on the late side to have begun an endeavor that most people are easing out of. I fear that it’s all foolishness. I don’t know… I got out this morning with Bob on a new route which he says is a 5.8 and I would’ve sworn it was a 5.9 or maybe even a 5.10.  I mean for me it was really hard but also fun. Maybe with the passage of summer, and having been away from climbing most of six months, I have forgotten just how strenuous it can be and how much work it is. That or suddenly Joshua Tree has changed everything  But it was a perfect day and perfect weather, it almost looks like spring with flowers blooming, not a soul the entire time we were out, but we did see a new kind of lizard.So one fine philosophical point… Why, save the best for last? Why wait until conditions are optimal to climb what we want to climb? It does occur to me that this is kind of the big hurrah—as I mentioned elsewhere, a time to lick all the frosting off the cake and smoke cigars just go for it. I mean, maybe the gift of aging is that you can finally fly your freak flag and no one‘s gonna say anything about it. It’s time to have a ball.With regards to this dog, she sure is 100% fun. I did buy the DNA kit because I’d really like to know what breed she is – – so far I’ve ruled out great Dane and basset hound    – – but anyway trying to get a swab in between her teeth and her cheek was hilarious. I don’t know if I got any DNA— she is just a dog-in-motion. And yeah, she’ll chase the tennis ball but she won’t exactly bring it back. She’ll drop it 10 or 15 feet away and then flop to the ground. She can be outside for up to an hour and still walk in the house and immediately pee on the floor.  ——Republican debates tonight. For you Republicans who watch I hope you’ll write tomorrow weighing in on your thoughts.

There is no other explanation for a dog this whack.I’ve been really focused on sport nutrition and diet lately. I’d rather do almost anything else but time and again climbing “at a certain age“ seems to require exceptional hydration, and at least 100 g of protein daily. With all the prodigious notes I’ve taken It’s just a straight across equation. If you don’t do well with dairy – – and I don’t – – then it comes down to a lot of meat or soy or other proteins sources. When I come close to that protein level, I have energy and I recover and my sleep is great. Without it I feel like the world is coming to an end.I keep meaning to let go of the registered dietitian I’ve been working with who is also a type one diabetic, and an athlete. There’s not much more he can really say to me, especially when I go bellyaching about dire fatigue. He’s asked me not just to guess what I ate and drank this week, but to have some facts. So I am firing up my Fitbit again, and I will do my best to log all food for a while.I keep playing around with electrolyte formulas, which are all really expensive. I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables, but on climbing days it’s not enough, so I keep Nuun tabs around and LMNT. Ben suggested Pedialyte and I thought of course! For a 10th of the cost I can get the same electrolytes in 1/3 of a cup. Add a pinch of sea salt and there you go.I was watching a video of a guy named D Griff,  who Joshua Tree regulars probably know. He somehow found me on Instagram so I took a look at his posts. When I was still just a visitor here, I sat on a rock in the Intersection parking lot, and watch this surfer dude saunter over to the base of intersection, butt out his cigarette, and saunter on up the hardest route on that rock. I mean, he literally looked so relaxed and so chill. Kind of reminded me of the grace watching John Bachar . So I know that will never be me, but it would be so nice to have a little swag and strength.Brownie Girl area. Pic by Bob.

We had a 'wellness check' from the Rescue guys last night.  They are wonderful people who really love their dogs.  I haven't seen a rescue place like this.  But we sat down and talked about the issues that have come up with our foster dog... particularly housetraining, but also her being so big and Tony completely unable to physically help with her care.  The Rescue sounded not surprised at all that this might not be a great fit... but I know that they have to find homes so they will maybe be a little overoptimistic with potential parents. She is a puppy, and a particularly hyperactive puppy, and will require perhaps a year and a half to fully calm down.  Tony just said she's 'too much' for us.  As fun as she is, I agree.One solution they suggested on the peeing issue is they are bringing some older dogs over this afternoon for a 3 hour playdate... .so the older dogs can show her how and where to pee outside.  That's a unique approach!  I've asked Tony to make the final decision on whether or not to keep trying to foster her.  No matter what, this dog will find a home and not be euthanized.  I never expected to get it right on the first try... but it's a very hard decision.  I keep checking out the four routes I want to climb (eventually) this year.  I have looked at Trix inside and out... there's just no way to tell how I would do on it until I'm actually tied in and on it.  But I can see why Bob is doubtful (and when Bob is doubtful, he seems to always be right).  I think if I could keep my cool, and not get flustered, I might have fun exploring and seeing what Trix is all about.  Meanwhile, there are so many others to visit and try out.  I won't be heartbroken if any one of these routes don't go.  What's everyone climbing/doing these days?

The foster system is not about a life commitment FYI Frank, it's mainly about keeping the mutts out of a caged environment, freeing space for other dogs.I go outside and piss with my dog about 360 nights a year, I like the idea of bringing in some local pisser's!Maybe Tony could help somewhere in the yard?

I am not going to dignify Frank’s comments. I try very hard to be kind on this thread, and I cannot think of a single time in five years that I was critical or disparaging of anyone here. I think somehow this group came together as a kind of very loose family, and I have appreciated all the friendship and support. it’s been such a total surprise to have met so many wonderful people who have stayed the course and shared their lives and stories.   I think we’ve also outgrown a lot of the swag and maliciousness on mountain project. At this age, every positive word adds to our happiness, and ability to keep on keeping on.So, we are in a 30 day formal foster arrangement with Issa, this beautiful dog. It was made clear from the outset that this is not an adoption. There are so many things to consider, including whether we can give her the love and kindness that she needs. Tony sustained a serious bite on his hand that went through to the bone, bled profusely and has been back-and-forth to the ER. That was nobody’s fault, but he has no use of his hand right now. On the other hand, I’m just really prayerful about this delightful creature. The guy from the rescue dropped by two days in a row to try to teach her how to pee outside. He brought her brother on Friday and they played for two hours solid just rolling in the dirt and kicking up dust. The whole point was for her brother, Gus, to show Issa how to pee, which he finally did and then she did, and we made a huge celebration out of it.To my way of thinking if we have loved her for 30 or 45 days we’ve done a good thing. If we feel like we can give her the home she needs will make that decision. Her playfulness is infectious, this morning, since I am not feeling well, she went outside and found her ball, and when no one threw it for her, she threw for herself and chased it through the yard. She’s a really special little person.this has become a much harder decision that I have expected and we are taking our time with it.

So, yesterday was a mind blowing day on the rock, and it restored some confidence for me in life after 70. One of the four routes I chose as goals for this year was Trix (10b/c). I have posted pictures of it over the last few years because it just calls to me. I mean to me the whole crag reminds me of the Adams family and I think it’s kind of creepy because the rock is a little bit shitty and I can envision Morticia living in those spires.. But every time I drive by I’m like “I want to climb that”.    I knew that this was much too hard for me and that the wise thing would be to work hard this season and maybe tackle it much later. But then I got to thinking why delay? Bob gave me the wary eye and lots of warnings that I might not like it, duly noted we went anyway.Sure enough once I tied in I was pretty sure I couldn’t do the first few moves to a high mantle safe spot at the start of the 10+ crack. But then, as the hours passed (long rests In between climbing), I got a little farther and a little farther, and on the last lap of the day somehow I was suddenly looking out over an enormous expanse of desert and stepping onto an absolutely featureless vertical piece of granite. I have never worked so hard or exhausted myself so completely and yet I was high as a kite when I got home and just mind boggled. I got to do something few people ever get to do (let alone “senior citizens“).  This route has crack, stemming, smearing, off width… The whole gamut.i’ve had the pleasure of watching Bob climb many times and it’s always impressive. I’ve also been on the coaching end of his training every time we go out. These days I feel like I can pretty well handle myself on a steep slab without a lot of help. But I had no idea what to do with this rock. Just getting ONTO the rock was a puzzle I couldn’t figure out. Then into that 10+ crack, which looks so easy from the ground but impossible once I was standing there trying to jam a toe in. Bob went on ahead of me and marked the holds most of which I didn’t see and never would have found on my own. It’s pretty incredible watching him whistle while he climbs and talk about the route as he goes. I guess I will always have this feeling that these rocks deserve a better climber than me, but I do my best and try to get over it.I wasn’t sure if I would want to go back and complete the route but of course I do. I think the very top will be over my head and require more strength than I’ve got. It’s the 10 C part of the climb and looks to me like it’s a tough overhang. I guess never say, never!Just feeling so much gratitude today.  Why stemming didn’t go so well.

Thank you so much rgold and Todd and I apologize for maybe over -sharing. This group has solved so many life challenges, most unrelated to Climbing and it’s just become natural for me to share the wins and losses here.I have rescued 4 dogs and Tony has rescued 3. But I’ve never seen anything like these guys who  have made themselves available 24 / seven and doing everything they can to make this a fit. I didn’t realize how many animals locally are euthanized. Most of them pitbull’s. Still it has to be a fit and it has to work over the long-haul.For instance, my friend Mallory’s Chihuahua brought out an uncommon desire for violence in me.    That dog barked for six solid weeks, and she did backflips and yelped at every meal. So that’s one dog that would have been out the door on the first day.One of the dilemmas is our dogs need for a lot of exercise and walks every day so I figure Brandt who’s already walking his dog… Why not add another?    —-If I may ask a non-Dog related question, yesterday according to my Whoop I worked out at just under my theoretical max most of the day.  I went to bed feeling surprisingly good and I woke up this morning feeling like I have the flu. I’ve been laying down most of the day and I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced becoming sick after a really hard workout. This is actually the second time this is happened, so I want to see what I can do to not have it happen again.

Came across this old Summit magazine from 1983. That's me on top of Headstone Rock in Joshua Tree after leading Southwest Corner (5.7). The follower was my first client as a professional guide. This year will mark my 40th season as a pro guide. Time flies!Coincidentally, I just found out that Summit magazine, published from 1955 to 1995, has been resurrected as Summit Journal, a high-end glossy mag much like the old Ascent magazine, priced at $60 a year (for just two issues). They serendipitously used the old cover shot in their ad for the new mag.

I'm just back from a Women's wellness weekend at a YMCA camp, about 2 hours north of here.It was soggy.I'm not in this pic, but I did climb on this stuff. Anyone know what the rock is? I thought basalt, but now I'm thinking no. IdahoBob, you know any blobs like this up your way? This is quite near Cascade, on private land, so there's no going back to exactly these rocks.It was soggy, this was an event, with guides, so the ropes went up the day before. Everything was sopping wet, and I didn't really make any progress up this at all. I was on "easier" stuff to the right. It's bulgy, with little to no handholds. And, it was slick and dirty.I did, however, get to have the fun of bouncing around on a rope that truly rivaled a bungee cord, it was so springy. Literally, it was fun, and yes all I was doing was boinging around a bit, and you'd get quite a lot of up and down, lol!The very snazzy camp had a shit ton of facilities to do all sorts of stuff. I got on their giant swing, but, knowing what CLIMBERS consider a swing, well, it was fun, but not exactly anything I'd be screaming about. Again, no pic of me. Here's a frame from someone else's ride in it. Full body harness, clipped to a snap shackle with a release you pull when ready. The staff have a rope they use (it goes to a pulley attached  to another tree), pulling you back and up to past horizontal, if you wanna get that far up. Then, you do a short countdown, yank a little pull cord to release the shackle, and let fly.The rigging was interesting. This is slung partway up some pretty burly conifers, but, the trees bow some, as you're swinging, so there's bounce, too. Surprisingly dynamic, for static cables!Then, there was also their outside climbing wall. It actually fun, but it kept getting rained out, at least when I had the open slots.There was a high and low challenge course, zipline, all sorts of sports fields and setups, artsy stuff, on and on. About 100 women attending.Oh.And Chef Steve. OMG. This was not REMOTELY close to the usual sort of food one gets for any sort of event like this.Departure time was noon today, and yet there was this enormous spread, not just dried up bagels and some coffee. It was really fun, and very nice to see how all these women just melted into relaxation.....and fun. The simple healing pleasure of play. And play we did!Re fostering pups?I ran into quite a lot of pups who were in temporary situations, when I filled in manning the library bookmobile now and then. It had steps that folded out when parked, which meant they were open steps, tread only. Scary, for dogs.The dogs were welcome to hop on, and were brought there as part of their training to eventually (perhaps) become service dogs of one sort or another. In fact, quite a lot of potential service dogs spend their early months with families who train them to be decent dogs. Step one. Then, if they get past that (often a 4H project for a kid, btw), then they go to another home, where they get additional training, such as those scary steps. THEN they might get to move up to the final trainings, eventually including training both dog and human. It's pretty cool to watch the process.*I do actually sympathize with Frank's empathy for the pooch, yes, leaving a shelter and going back could be terrible. But it isn't always like that.Dogs are pack creatures, after all, which helps them to be able to go from person to person, place to.place, so long as they are getting good care. Shelters aren't optimal, I'd bet we could all easily agree on that, but it sounds like this one is really trying pretty darn hard.This dog does seem to have an abundance of sparkle, so that should help, even if Lori and Tony simply aren't the right match for this cutey. Don't despair yet, Frank! You're a curmudgeon for sure, but also a softie, with pups. Best, Helen *Edit to add, Idaho, as do many places, actually has a program for prison inmates to work with dogs, to make them more adoptable. Edit 2, it's raining in Boise, too. Catcat is most displeased with that.

Sitting around camp watching people and making up stories about them. If only they knew.  It’s midday and The Bavarian has only just finished grooming himself while singing in a high pitched tone. When I left for town he was twirling his moustache. When I returned he was clipping his toe nails. He has lovely long blonde hair that’s plaited. I think he’s in love with the albino chubby fellow, who goes by the name of Louise. Heinrich (The Bavarian) has a very very large van. Inside he grows mushrooms in a room lined with coloured Luci lights. They share a very complicated washing line with Serious Long Haired Dude, who plays the guitar, although not well, and in an uninterested way. Heinrich likes to walk about shirtless while adjusting the elastic waistband of his green kletter trousen singing in his high pitched plaintive way. One would think that Louise would be the camp bitch, but it appears Serious Long Haired Dude is astonishingly domestic.

I have returned cats after a week or so trying to make it work. Some critters simply are not a good fit.  Finally got to climb after a couple weeks of working really hard.  I had a 3 day photo gid in my old stomping grounds so i talked my friend Reed into driving down there sunday for a half day of climbing. The colors are popping.Reed following Center Crack. its a lot more work to lead it than solo it... Reed following Off width. same observation as with center crack. I had no clue these climbs were so burly ;) its fairly steep right here Lorie but this is a good example of what good footwork and posture can do for you. Reed following Extra Stout. I forgot to take a photo on Wild woman but my elbow is telling me its steep and pumpy... .

The colors are popping.Wow! Those New England fall colors. I have great memories of New Hampshire.As we think about adopting another cat, we're considering our limitations -- we'll be looking for an older cat and a fairly lightweight one. So far we've been lucky finding cats we've grown to love. I had some doubts when we first adopted Stormy because of his need to roam and a few times he lashed out at me. But he became the most loving, if always independent, companion. I've noticed that our local humane society, where we adopted our last three cats, has a special category of less socialized "working cats," who are more suited to living on farms, nurseries, or the like than to being house pets.

I tried one that kept peeing on my bed. Xmas morning she peed on me while I was sleeping.sent her right back to jail and took a kitty that was so shy that no one would adopt it. He ended up being awesome but I was the only person who could ever touch him and no one other than Isa and myself ever saw him. He was very good at hiding. I called him the invisible cat but he would hang with me. As soon as he heard another vehicle come up the driveway he was disappeared.

I had no expectation of actually climbing it -- and from the outset it looked like I might not even get off the ground.  But it was the hardest workout I've had in ages, and it answered the question for me of whether at 70 I had any business on the rock.  I really needed a hit of confidence. Reviewing some of those moves/sequences this morning, I think perhaps I can one day climb them clean, at least in part.  It's that upper 10c face that may not happen (and that's the part I want to happen).  Blue arrow, first ledge off the ground--looked like it was going to have to be a very tall mantle, but we figured out a workaround.  Yellow arrow, upper headwall, with some kind of overhang... don't think I can do it.  But I want to try. My Primary at Kaiser referred me over to their sport medicine doc.  We had a great phone appointment on Friday... and I think I have a team now.  This doctor is also the doctor for the Sport teams in Indio... attends all their football games, and he's big into nutrition, sleep, etc.  He said he has not had a 70 year old patient.He also said there is NO data for older people who are athletes, or very active.  "Lori, we're in this together and I won't abandon you... we'll see this through."  Starting with a journal of 7 days food, fluids, exercise, sleep, RHR, etc.  He's hooking me up with the Registered Dietician he works with.  The nice thing is he also reviewed all my lab tests and diabetic issues, knows that history and can work with it.  What I'm starting to think, with these docs having on average 2400 patients each... is that it must be a huge upper to have someone who is not desperately ill and where they can help in a positive way.  They cannot be the healers they wanted to be... they are herding patients through so quickly.  So, I guess what I'm saying is this is new territory for everyone, we CAN be strong, we CAN climb (unless injured), there are no known limits except the LazyBoy.  Dealing with a little bit of lung/asthma issues.  I haven't given up on Ancestral Supplements.  The Heart and Lung saved Tony from Congestive Heart Failure... twice.  They are so powerful.  So, I've started on the lung formula, to try to help with the post-exertion asthma, and the new dog.

I think it was a symptom of a UTI and failing kidney. She was probably ~20 when we put her down. She was a shy cat, but a lap cat to us. Stormy was the opposite with people. He visited everyone in our cul de sac.Lori, as you said, slow and fairly steady. My PT is giving me some challenging exercises and prescribes lots of walking. Always cats. No dogs.

This was a pretty young cat from the shelter. less than a year old. whatever the issue was I did not want to deal with it. she did know the drill but about once ever week she would pee on the bed. doing it with me in the bed and soaking me with her pee on  Christmas morning was the last straw.  she had her chance but if you fuck up your parole too many times you go back to prison. is what it is...  she would have been a fine barn cat but the folks at the shelters are too woke to allow outside cats.  My current cat Hugi.

I cannot find Guy's post about climbing language... sort of scolding me for using terms like 'put up' a route, etc.  I've kept an ear out ever since.  Over and over, on various podcasts and interviews, climbers refer to routes they 'put up'... including Honnold at Red Rock.  It's a little awkward to try to fit in 'a route I did the first ascent on'.  What's the scoop on the verbiage?

Humans kill way more wildlife than most species combined, I'd bet between our cars and windows in our houses we kill 10-100 times the birds that cats do! Besides, where I live, our cats focus on rodent control and that makes me very happy. What really disgusts me is folks that poison rodents which in turn kills birds like owls, eagles and hawks that eat them.Hey Carl, ever had to defend yourself from a kangaroo?

I don’t know why I keep coming back to climbing given what it requires. It’s just never been a stroll in the park for me, or a casual frolic. There are times when I am working through a crux move that I will ask “why are we doing this again?“ – – is this supposed to be fun?My daughter is 43 and has been laid low over the last three years with the after effects of Covid and also just having a husband and kids and a job.. She’s done everything she can including the best diet and supplements etc. and she just can’t seem to get on top of things. we were talking yesterday and while the best advice is to put herself to bed and rest more, she’s considering something extraordinary like another four or five days on Mount Shasta.We talked about that hit of adrenaline, and that boost of confidence when you get through that “assault on yourself“. I think that trip to Shasta might be medicine for her after all.  My attempt on Trix wore me out, but made me high as a kite. I’ve been smiling a lot this week. So maybe this is a special thing that only climbers understand?I have to laugh sometimes when I imagine Bob thinking “this woman has no business being out here“ and maybe just being too polite to say so.    It’s wonderful to know that you are out climbing too, Guy.——The journey with our puppy Issa continues. The owner of the rescue, Blaze, came by again yesterday for another couple of hours with Gus, her brother. OMG. The two of them chased and rolled in the dirt and romped without stopping. All I could see was a dust cloud wherever they went. I mean she flies!  Tony said out of the blue “I think I would miss her if she was gone“. Believe it or not, I am more worried about her than us. All the what if‘s, especially as we age. How horrible it would be if we just couldn’t give her what she needs. It turns out Blaze was a trainer in New York on some of the 911 teams. He gave us sort of the protocol for the next year for Issa, including what she should be able to do in three months, six months, etc. And he himself would be happy to do the training for a pretty steep price, but he doesn’t think it’s necessary. We have another 30 days to decide and even after that if we just couldn’t take care of her she would go back to Blaze. Well, I have occupied myself with Wordle and spelling bee for a while now, but this new game called connections, I suck at.  anybody playing it here?

When it comes to declining bird populations, I think the biggest problem may be loss of habitat from human development. Maybe that's not our backyard songbirds, but various other species. I dunno. It does seem to me that some cats are bird-killing machines and others aren't particularly interested.Lori, Connections is very hit and miss (by far mostly miss) for someone as out of touch with pop culture as I am.

An average of 599,000,000 bird deaths annually from collisions with building glass, second only to deaths by cats.I've seen a few fatal bird strikes at my Joshua Tree house, mostly into my large living room window.One day I was sitting in my living room, watching TV, when I was startled by a loud crash into the small window (with drawn curtains) immediately behind me. I thought someone had thrown a rock at my window. I went outside and was sad to see a large cooper hawk, laid out on the porch, with a contorted neck. Seeing me seemed to agitate it, so I went back inside to let it die in peace. I went back out about 15 minutes later and it was upright. It stared at me for a few minutes, then it flew off. Turns out there was a 4-inch tall figurine of a roadrunner sitting on the window sill and the hawk must have dive-bombed at full speed to kill it! I guess it was OK since a few days later I saw it swoop down and snatch an antelope ground squirrel from my back yard, then fly up into a tree and proceed to tear it apart and eat it right in front of me.

I’m a pretty well published scientist and most of what has been said is either not true or unrealistic (you can’t study the entire population- that’s why we have statistics). :)I was laying in bed this morning thinking about the disparity between how many rock climbers there are versus how many tourists come to this Park. The folks who say they took a count at the entrance gates and came up with some incredibly high numbers of rock climbers doesn’t jive with what I see here. How exactly would you take this census? Do you ask every car full of people on a weekend why they’re here? What days do you choose to take this poll?Here’s my intuitive hunch: I don’t think there’s many rock climbers at all any longer. I am kind of thinking that roped rock climbing is out of vogue.  At least here. But also having met a few women “of a certain age“ who loved to say they were climbers couldn’t hack it here. Trad climbing, especially, may not have all the amenities that the gym climbers cherish. This may not be everyone’s cup of tea.I am reminded of when we spent so many Easter vacations and summers at the Colorado river and watched speed boats race up and down in front of Fox’s restaurant, and, we waterskied the heck out of that river and lake Havasu. Then all of the sudden there were a few jet skis. And then one day you never saw another water skier unless they were an old fossil— the river was teaming with jetskiers. My hunch is that roped rock climbing  is giving way to bouldering for the younger generations. I really hope I’m wrong. But I can say this, with the exception of the 5% most popular climbs on holiday weekends I just don’t see climbing going on here.What this has to do with how many birds, I don’t know. But by the way – – I recall water skiing from dam to dam all day long on the Colorado River doing laps and never getting tired. And then not too long ago I water skied on Folsom lake and could barely hang on with my arms. Has anyone else gone back to a sport that was once so fun and easy and found you are not fit enough for it now?On a sad note, I don’t even know if there is much of a river left. One of the most sacred and healing places for me in the world was Parker Dam. It would kill me now to see this beloved river, barely a trickle.

The references are all there on the website I linked. Note: not a single reference is used for all the various data. Generally, one paper looks at one cause of mortality, and each paper uses data from a wide variety of sources to get an estimation. Overall, the data in that table probably is the summary result of a hundred different studies, using funding from a wide variety of sources. This is always how this type of analysis is done, and it's why the Fish and Wildlife service is confident enough to publish those numbers of their website.

One out of 3 of my cats kills birds, but rarely.  Mostly the 2 that hunt eat rodents.  I know because they bring them to me most of the time.  And the birds that they do eat are almost exclusively house sparrows and house finches, both imports from Europe.  And there are no other animals to take the weak and slow in the burbs so I figure cats are just doing their part to insure natural selection continues unabated even here.  I praise my cat every time he has something wild to eat - smaller cat food bill for me!

My opinion on cats and birds. Impossible to say anywhere close to the number of birds killed each year by cats. In a lot of ways it doesn't matter. (when I say "should" this is nothing more than my opinion)A lot of factors to consider:1. cats are naturally predatory animals*. and to some degree live for the hunt and depriving them of that can create bigger issues:a. cats that have been outside and have a taste for it (not a phrase I like but is good for this discussion) will demand to be outside. by demand I mean will urinate and defecate outside the litter box and be very destructive to anything soft.b. the number one reason that cats are surrendered and then euthanized is for urinating outside the litter box.  2. IMO cats should not be allowed to go outside if they can be stimulated enough inside--this generally applies to cats that are adopted as young kittens. A lot of behaviorists will say that this applies to all cats, but practically this is a different story from a time and money standpoint. So if it comes down to surrendered to be euthanized versus killing birds. Im sorry, but I'm picking the cats. I would take exception if I lived in an area where an endangered or watch list bird lived/frequented. In that case I would adopt a kitten that hasn't spent a day outside or not own a cat. 3. Cats that live or spend time outside will have much shorter lives due to contagious diseases, predators and cars. These diseases are communicable to other cats--a few things can be transmitted to humans as well, so could pose a health risk to immunocompromised people.a. cats that go outside should be tested for FeLV and FIV yearly, IMO, and of course kept up to date on vaccines. If they ever come positive for FeLV or FIV, they should be kept inside or surrendered to households that only have other positives. b. owners of outdoor cats should be financially ready to treat fight wounds and decide how far you'll go with life threatening injuries beforehand: i.e. outdoor cat gets hit by a car and has a broken leg--spend $1500 to have it amputated, $4000 to have it plated or $200 to put it down. I naturally prefer the first 2, but understand option 3.*The behaviorist Temple Grandin (watch the HBO movie about her with Claire Daines) says dogs are 4 generations from adapting to being wild animals and cats are 4 hours.

First, yes, some cats kill birds, some don't. Mine doesn't even mill around outside much anymore, mainly just goes out for a bit of a look, and back in to her heating pad. She was never a bird stalker, but she'd spend time lying in wait to nab a mouse or vole, in her younger years. Voles are native (?), but the mice aren't.And?That study excluded dogs, and natural predation. Pets are (mostly) living in manmade habitats these days, so are the birds our pets have access to. Those birds may be prey for pets, but, if they were living away from our pets, they'd be prey for predators our pets have replaced.Even though I'm in town, it's a bit wilder in my yard than some places. That's true for Boise generally. Having both a river through town, plus open irrigation canals all over the place, means just about every critter possible might show up anywhere at all here. That's been pretty fun, over the years!This spring, as in previous years, the main neighborhood predator was the resident red tailed hawk. She catches ducklings, lots of ducklings, magpies, a snake now and then, that I've seen.There was also a young, and pretty incompetent, coyote one morning, trying unsuccessfully to catch one of the full grown chickens that run loose. The chickens flew, and scattered all over the place.Before this, there was a fox for a long time. That fox, jumping our back fence, is when the cats we had at the time became indoor cats!My immediate neighborhood had a badger for a long time, plus the transients, deer, an elk....and birds, of course.Downtown Boise gets everything. Bear, cougars, loads of deer, elk, beaver, mink, etc, and a least one wolf wandered through. It's fun and entertaining when the leo peeps are trying to herd an elk or moose away from traffic! The bears usually get treed somewhere, and f and g deal with them. Now and then a young cat will get treed too. But the cougars are stealthy. Usually just paw tracks in snow/mud to mark they've been there.@Guy, peppers will be picked soon, then need to dry a bit. Send a pm with a mailing address and I'll ship some off to ya! Remember to set some seed aside, as you use them. You'll hafta grow your own plants and save seed from them, to go forward. I can't guarantee these aren't crossed with anything, but I don't think they are.Still not got out climbing, since I got back after last weekend. It's been wet here, but supposed to go indian summer on us, looks like, so maybe??I just got vaccinated yesterday, 3 shots total lol, so both arms are toast today. Stuffy nose and cough, too, dunno which one did that, but it should be gone shortly. I usually have almost nothing at all from these. Almost never get sick, either. Although, many of us are sneezing our heads off. It's been a glorious year, with the early big rains and not too hot summer, for sagebrush. It blooms in fall, and even if you grow up with it, can still nail people.Woke up stupid early. Hafta wait a few hours to get hints for the last few spelling bee words, but I have most of that done. The connections thing went today, but, yeah, it's hit and miss for me. Wordle, I get almost always. I keep not getting a streak though, so somehow it doesn't record, or I miss a day. The letterboxed thing is hardish. I do the mini crossword, now and then the full size one, but those get hard, too.Today is house and yard stuff, try to get caught up. Maybe unload all the stuff still in my car from last weekend, lol!Best, Helen

Greg, we’ll have to keep a tally this season.   This conversation takes me back to my very first post on mountain project where I had literally just stood in the middle of the intersection rock parking lot and asked “How do I do this?”  it wasn’t just learning about shoes and gear and rocks.  For me, it was primarily about having a partner, and one who can tolerate my newness.  And then it was about getting fit enough to climb, arranging trips and lodging from a long distance, and showing up often enough to not lose any gains.if a young person can get here at all, they’re going to be bouldering. This really is a dirt baggers game, or for a person who is willing to blow most of their retirement to move to a climbing area and pay to climb. (Of course I envy those who have lived here forever and have competent partners and are already strong climbers like Russ and Todd and Dave Evans, Brandt.)We are so fortunate in my opinion. There is nothing like clean air and hard exercise and something exhilarating to do. I remember sitting in the parking lot of Pipeworks in Sacramento and seeing all the shiny new cars pulling in and young hip suburbanites walking into the gym with their great outfits after work. Ryan who worked at Pipeworks told me that less than 5% of their 600 members had ever or would ever climb outside. I guess that’s a great alternative if you have a job and responsibilities but it’s a distant second choice for me.—-I have never had such difficulty making a decision about a pet.  As I sit here writing this at 6 AM this dog has tried to take my robe off my body, pull my slippers off my feet, and shred a couple of paper towels and race through the house with her squeak toy and try to get some more marrow out of her dog bone, and it is hysterical. But it turns out that Tony is so allergic to this dog that he has to be on a high dose of anti-histamine all day every day and my childhood asthma has come back, which is pretty scary. I had an appointment with the allergist at Kaiser and she drew blood and it turns out I have no allergies to all the pollen around here but a pretty severe allergy to dog and cat dander. I haven’t had to use an inhaler since I was a child. I just got a second large air purifier and I’m using the HEPA filters in our vacuum, keeping our bedroom off-limits, and I gave this mutt  another bubble bath. Every day we keep her I grow more attached. I’m just trying to buy time right now to see if we can find enough solutions to make it work.

Helen, Boise just comes alive with your descriptions.  I have just been so grateful that there are no big predators out where I hike however I now understand that there are mountain lions and they do attack.  But mostly it’s bugs, and scary ones, but nothing like facing down a bear. I have been assured though that we do not want a cat or a dog to be loose outside because coyotes are pretty stealthy around here. Let little  Fluffy go out for a pee and all you have is a tuft of fur left. Also, several family dogs were killed this week by rattlesnakes right on their own front porch. I have been told that in the event of a snake bite you want to get a dog to the vet within 20 minutes and that antivenin will cost about 3500 bucks and that could work, but probably wouldn’t. If it takes any longer than that to get to the vet the best decision is probably to let the dog go. Maybe all the cats I had were somehow deficient because I never had a hunter. I did have one who attempted it once and gave it up. My last cat was not a winter person and she pretty much positioned herself next to my floor heater and I don’t believe she moved from November through March. I took a picture of her every day, and that was the invention of the cat-cam from which sprung the shoe-cam— my biggest unsung contribution to the Climbing world.

Why am I here?" , at least once.  So friends of mine who have come here to climb, do so once... for the experience.  A gym is nicer.  A local cafe is nicer.  TALKING about climbing is almost the same as doing it.  This is just hard work (but someone's gotta do it!   )------------Totally off any relevant subject, but it's on my mind.  I have a friend who is serving 19-life in San Quentin--and he's now been there 22 years, and due for another parole date shortly.  I didn't know him before he committed his crime, I was introduced while he was sitting in El Dorado County Jail awaiting his sentencing.  He had admitted to what he did (a violent assault that lasted a few minutes and did not actually physically injure his victim, but terrified her), and he did not want to put his family or the victim through any more heartache... so he signed some 30 charges 'guilty' in pencil, without benefit of counsel.  So, he's been from one prison to the next... with a perfect record, not one misdeed.  He's now 55 (this week!).  I've never gone to see him because, embarrassingly, I froze every time I got to the iron gates and the towers with the guards and guns...  the biggest prison (Soledad) you have to surrender everything on your person, including purse, food, insulin supplies) and wait for a BUS to drive you clear across the prison grounds to a holding room, where you wait for them to go fetch your prisoner and bus him on over... and there you can visit together, until the next scheduled departure.  I was warned that there was no leaving if I needed to.  So, we have never met face to face, yet have exchanged hundreds of letters and phone calls over the years.This month all prisoners were issued laptops with texting and video capability.  Eric had never seen a computer, cell phone or laptop before... he and I are finally going to get to meet 'virtually'.  It made me sad when he told me that his hair is now white, his beard is white.  He was a young, vibrant 33 year old redhead at the time of his crime, with a wife and 3 kids.  All have abandoned him.  If ever people needed friendship and support, it's the incarcerated.  EDIT: Just anticipating some cynical responses, early on in my friendship with Eric I had to verify his story for myself.  So I ordered all police and court reports, even got the hospital records, and I have a copy of that signed plea deal checked off by Eric.  I also read the one letter his Public Defender wrote to him.. I've seen people better represented for a speeding ticket.  And I've never heard Eric complain.  Not once.

Lori, you've written of this friend before. It sounds like he (perhaps?) made his peace with this situation, when he made those penitential (as in penance) choices so long ago. Being paroled could be traumatic, maybe, after all this time? Glad you two get to move into a new era of penpalling! Enjoy your friendship. It's an extraordinary kindness you've extended.As to not as many climbers?At COR, it used to be heavily climber visitation, 85% or something. But then the pandemic came around, and a bazillion people suddenly decided to go camping, or to National Parks, or buy every bicycle in existence.....They suddenly discovered outdoor places they enjoy. I have no idea what the "official" line would be, but, when there is no longer any "slow" season for the staff there, park filled even in the hot months of July and August? Then yes, it's less climbers, but more people, methinks.H.Edit to add, hunt up Matt Fultz, if you'd like to see the Idaho boy who bouldered where I do! He found hard stuff out there, at a young age, so the term "boy" is reasonable. All grown up now, of course, but still a young crusher. He was pretty amazing to watch in person, at a local bouldering comp a few years ago. Amazing power, and control, too! He was the one competitor who could stop the swing on a traversing dyno. Twice. Just.....nail it.

If Joshua Tree is indeed seeing fewer climbers ( at least using ropes), it could well be because it is not considered a sport climbing destination ( I know there are some, probably quite a few, sport climbs there, but that style still isn’t what the area is known for). You should treasure the relative ‘emptiness’, most places I’ve climbed in recently ( both pre and post-pandemic) , primarily, but not exclusively, sport climbing areas, have been packed with climbers. And the numbers seem to be growing exponentially. Enjoy the solitude.

Its become enjoyment from the lowest common denominator possible. Bouldering is the easiest climbing activity to get into, sport next and then trad. Its the same with biking, motorized sports and even peak bagging. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few activities that have trended towards *easy* but it seems to be happening as quickly as climate change. I'm all for it.

Had a HORRIBLE day climbing yesterday on some slab. Easy but hard. Little protection, no real holds, high feet. I hate slab. Only a grade 13 (5.7) but the crux straight off the deck felt hard. Then my mate started the second pitch and couldn’t continue. Had to be rescued from above. Then by then I’d had enough and didn’t want to continue the third pitch after my one piece of gear fell out under a cami judged as shit.

The dogs and I (the two prettiest retrievers in history) are going to perfect granite in wonderful wilderness at 9,000 feet... to replace rusty, ancient and beyond their lifespan old bolts with half inch stainless beauties provided by the American Safe Climbing Association (great organization, give often and generously).It's pure labor, but someone's got to do it.

What the heck is “deicide”? Helen?  I just quit Spelling Bee lately rather than go to the community for hints. But when I discover the next day that there was a word like deicide, like that’s not fair!Thank you for your thoughts on Eric. I guess he’s on my mind today because I thought he’d be out of prison five years ago and his birthday is this week. Before during the longest time when we were both going through such difficult challenges, it was Eric who would call and just know what to say. And I was always telling him you will have your springtime Eric. This does have a beginning, middle, and an end. Well, spring has come and gone. But to the deeper questions of how this crime came to be, and why he didn’t try to save himself – – something about a fundamentalist Baptist upbringing, where the standup thing to do was admit when you’ve done something wrong, and accept the consequences like a man. That’s how he was introduced to me by a CO at the jail, as “the only guilty Man in County Jail“.   But five years, even, 10 years in, all appeals processes were gone and then it was the parole hearings where he felt like he could handle them on his own or with studying in the prison library and be assigned defender and three times he was firmly shut down and given an additional three or five years,. I offered him a great attorney, who would have prepared him and vigorously advocated for his release, and he just couldn’t bear for me to spend the money.Maybe what this has to do with Climbing is I am doing some (climbing) and he now has white hair and white beard and his years are flying by and his health is for shit. He has a friend in me for life, but this is now very difficult.——Tony and I have been watching the most miserable depressing series on HBO and I hate it but keep going back. It was called the leftovers. Fortunately it was only three seasons long and so this wraps up soon for us but it’s rare for me to watch something that just so dark.  It was so well acted and scripted that it’s hard to look away.—-How is everyone on there olive oil? I just got the results of my bone scan and over the last 10 years I have built back most of the bone I lost earlier… The thing they say cannot be done. Tony has taught me to love olive oil.“A Mediterranean diet … that is enriched with extra virgin olive oil (about 4 tablespoons per day) has been linked with a significantly lower risk of osteoporosis-related fracture compared to following a diet consisting of less extra virgin olive oil (about 1.5 tablespoons per day). An analysis of observational studies also found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was linked with a 21% lower risk of hip fracture and higher bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and hip (Malmir, Eur J Nutr 2018). “This is the one we use

I'd have to say that Al R is right on his comments about Joshua Tree. Even though there is a sport climbing guide book, and there actually are a few very good sport routes here, JT will never be high on any serious sport climber's list of destinations. A number of areas in California, which in the past were less known, have become more popular.And yes, it's been quite nice having the crags a bit less crowded.

We dropped everything, carried him out and tore off into town. Elapsed time to vet was around 30 minutes. We got lucky the vet was actually there (it was Sunday). She pumped him full of saline.

Joshua Tree is devoid of "climbers" because it has no warm fuzzies.  It's a ball buster area and the participation ribbon kids are not getting what they need when climbing here.  There is much more touchy feely grab ass to be had in the gym or at a true sport area.

I did wonder if it was the Great Corner ( though I have no memory of that huge jug just below the belay—-but it has been 55 years!!!). Still, while, like most dihedrals, the corner does require good footwork, I still don’t consider that pitch to be a slab. But then again, you do consider 200 foot solos to be ‘bouldering’, so we seem to be working from differing definitions of terms!!!!

Lori, The key to identifying routes is to get in a position that is as much "across" from the formation as possible [hint: these are where most pictures in guides/on-line are taken]. Also, read the descriptions of the routes on the same formation for relative location.Grain Surgery sits on the face maybe 60 feet left of Decompensator. There is a chimney system that separates these two faces of this section of Steve Canyon.See your photo:

Here's an excerpt from the intro to my book Toproping:"It’s true that bouldering, with its inherent simplicity, is less complicated than toproping, with a great sense of freedom of movement, unfettered by complicated gear and rigging. But bouldering is very limiting in another way: The higher you climb above the ground, the scarier it gets. And one thing is certain: When you fall, you hit the ground. Hitting the crash pad from 10 feet off the ground can be a bone-jarring experience. Many of my fellow climbers sustained the most serious injuries of their entire climbing careers because of a fall while bouldering.Lead climbing is challenging both physically and mentally—figuring out not only the moves but also the complexities of protection placements along the way. The mental focus required to lead difficult trad (traditional) routes is intense, including the psychological aspect that comes into play when you move high above your protection, risking a long leader fall. Sport climbing is less demanding psychologically, allowing you to push physical boundaries, but stopping and clipping a long series of bolts interrupts the purity of the flow.Free soloing has been said to be the purest form of rock climbing, but there is a fine line between the pure joy of fun-in-the-sun rock climbing, moving and flowing up the climb with nothing but air beneath your feet, and the sudden shadow of fear that can take over as quickly as a dark cloud eclipsing the sun. The free soloist faces the possibility of the ultimate irony: falling and dying as a direct result of being afraid to die, knowingly risking life for the pleasure of pure, unfettered freedom of movement.So for many, toproping is the most relaxing form of rock climbing, and definitely the safest. With the practice of sound safety fundamentals, the toprope climber, free from the psychological fear of falling, uninterrupted from any need to place or clip protection, can achieve a Zen-like purity of focused movement rarely attained in the other forms of rock climbing."

You distill down the disciplines of rock climbing well!i don't really think bouldering is the most pure (pure is a silly distinction imo) i do think its the most fun for me of the disciplines of climbing for a lot of personal reasons. i do think it can be done in a way that limits injury. personally, i do a lot of rehersal on rappel (grigri with knots) on anything thats insecure feeling for me. even a 10 foot high boulder ill rehearse.

Randy, I want to thank you for always dishing up the scoop on rock formations when I get a little lost. I really enjoy exploring unfettered and just see what I see. But I specifically wanted to know where Grain Surgery was, now I know.    This morning I headed out for the short walk back there and turned out I couldn’t figure out how to scramble to Grain Surgery. I can usually figure it out pretty easily, but I tried a dozen different ways and decided that if it’s through these boulders, I should go with someone. Is the approach possibly through the backside? decompensator rock is just stunning, and I love knowing that at some point I’ll be trying it out.I had to swing by Trix, of course, and take another look at that very top portion. I am shaking my head wondering, whatever was I thinking? But as far as climbing goes, I have already learned some valuable lessons on this rock. Probably the biggest one is to try to figure out as much as possible from the ground. Bob has harped on this a lot – – the issue of getting pumped, losing all your strength while you’re trying to suss out a sequence. So, especially on this rock, I’d like to try learning as much as I can from the comfort of the ground. This would be the first route I can think of where the superhuman effort needs to come at the very top. If you’ve already thrown away all your energy working the bottom of the route you’ll never finish the crux.I can clearly see that this top part is too hard for me, but I am willing to try. I’m willing to learn and it can never really be a loss.—-i’ve had to think twice before adding this to my post. I never want to be disloyal to Tony in any way. Lately over the last year or two I have been having to say everything to Tony twice, three times, and sometimes shout. I honestly didn’t think it was a hearing issue. I was just thinking he is not paying attention. Last night I got pretty frustrated and just sad “hey, what is going on? This is really frustrating to have to say everything two and three times.“ Tony had no idea that this was happening.  He asked me to talk in a normal voice and he said it sounded like a whisper. When I spoke full volume,  even a shout, he said “now I can hear you just fine“. I’ve been fearful for the two of us, and didn’t realize how difficult it is when you take away normal communication. We both need our hearing checked. I would hate to see if he or I have to wear hearing aids, but shouting is awful. I told him I feel like I’m being aggressive and angry, and he said he never saw that way.  But I think without hearing you can miss a lot in the world.  Really glad I finally brought this up.

I can feel the "Zen-like purity" of climbing on easy (to me) trad, sport boulder or TR and thats kinda what I like doing these days, just mindlessly cruising up stuff. Like I said before, my ideal day would be doing 20 pitches of 5.8 where I can practically turn my brain off, tune everything out and just climb. Of course the occasional OH SHIT climbing keeps the tools sharp but it's just not that important or fun to me to always be pushing hard.I once heard that hearing aids are useful tools for happy marriages, I would bet that lack of hearing could save some marriages as well!

I am almost completely deaf in my left ear (congenital), and just fine in my right. I didn't really even notice this for my entire life, until the little I had on the left was disappearing. What clued me in, was realizing I couldn't hear the summer crickets, if my right ear was on my pillow.So, off to the hearing and balance center. I've had a single hearing aid for about 5 years now, it was about 5 or 6 grand, iirc, with insurance covering much or all of it. Don't remember. I only wear it now and then, cuz it really doesn't matter much when I'm alone, plus, I hear well without it. Just not if you are sitting on my left side. Then, I have to turn toward you. With the hearing aid? I know what people tables away are saying, lol!Hearing aids are now MUCH less expensive, so there's no reason not to get them. And great reasons why you should, not the least being that correcting age related hearing loss is the single most effective way to ward off dementia. Yes, dementia.You do have to wear them, and get used to them, though. After that, especially if you have people you care about in your life, you'll wonder why you didn't get them sooner.Then you'll start realizing how many others of us have hearing aids, even younger people, and really feel stupid for waiting. This isn't our younger selves memories of our grandparents world anymore, it's vastly changed from then!Best, Helen

But I specifically wanted to know where Grain Surgery was, now I know.    Yes, I need a life.Interesting story about that wall... a load of years ago, probably on one of the first times I ever climbed in the Monument, we were wandering around Steve Canyon looking at routes, and for some reason, I decided Deflowered (5.6) looked like a fun time. So I racked up and fired the route. A friend came up behind me, cleaning gear, when she got to a 3.5 Friend somewhere in the upper part of the crack. And it was stuck. Like hopelessly stuck. Being a time when I had just assembled a lead rack that actually contained some camming units, I was not happy. Once she got to the top, I rapped down to see if I had any better luck. Yup, it was stuck. But I wasn't taking "stuck" for an answer, so while she waited patiently for me, I ran back to my nearby car and got a hammer and a big screwdriver. Returning, I reclimbed back up to the cam and proceeded to pound it out of the crack a quarter inch at a time. The screwdriver left notches in the holes of the cams where I was pounding on them, but I was getting that thing out of there (it was just going to be garbage left in the crack if I couldn't get it out - bad form). Eventually, I got it back out and it went home with me. I probably still have it around here somewhere... On trips back into Steve Canyon to climb other things over the years, I've looked at Deflowered in the intervening years and it looks sorta semi-wide and burly... but I was young, had big hands, and liked that kind of thing back then. I'm much more refined now. Ha ha ha ha!!

You pay for it out of pocket. But classic Medicare plus a supplemental is like a PPO. Lots of freedom for which docs to go to.   If you get an "Medicare Advantage" plan, some of them do cover things that classic Medicare doesn't cover (Dental, Vision, Hearing).  That is usually the way they pitch to you about why they are a better choice.  But Advantage plans are like HMOs, you are restricted in using their network and there can be some serious disadvantages with that. We have plenty of friends who chose and Advantage plan and have all kinds of roadblocks seeing specialists when they have issues.  I've personally always hated HMOs, esp as an athlete when you don't want months of gatekeeping for orthopedic stuff and other specialties. I'd rather pay a bit more for my plan and have the freedom to choose my doc and see a specialist without a referral.  I have classic Medicare and a AARP United Health "cadillac" plan (F or G, I forget) which includes coverage outside the US. I love it.But yeah, if I ever need a hearing aid, I'll pay out of pocket.  My husband lost one of his in his recent bike accident and just ordered a new pair.  He said our Supplemental plan entitled him to a good discount.

Thank you Greg!  Even with Randy’s arrow on my last picture I STILL couldn’t figure it out.  I also couldn’t figure out what this was.   To me these are separate spires, or pillars… not a wall. So I was attempting to scramble past them both to the next formation and through some huge boulders. Glad I gave that up.  I feel like a real numnutz.——Thank you so much everyone for your responses on hearing aids. It’s humbling to reach out with personal problems, but even more humbling to thrash about alone. I will make an appointment for us both this week and then will get this taken care of. I thought of hearing aids as devices that crackle and pop and drive you crazy. It sounds like things have improved. As Rgold sad it is frustrating and isolating, and I thought we were stuck with it.As for glasses, It’s sad when something comes down to ego, but my claim to fame as a kid was my x-ray vision. It was far better than 2020 for most of my life until the day I became diabetic. Suddenly I was nearly blind for a while. And now I can see, but especially with climbing I use reading glasses. On slab routes if I forget to put the glasses on everything is one blank rock. When I put the glasses on the whole thing comes alive and I can see those credit card size crimps and foot holds so if it’s a choice—the vanity has to go. Thank you all again.

That was 30 years ago.  There's been a whole lot of improvement since then.  My hearing don't make any sounds.I should add that although the improvement in hearing from hearing aids is very substantial and I would be miserable going back to what's left of my declining hearing, we most likely cannot be corrected back to normal hearing.  Crowded rooms and other situations with background noise can be quite problematic, and movies and TV are tough to understand as well.

I’m so glad people are weighing on this and I don’t feel so alone.  it seems to be what this group does. I’m sorry you’ve had a rough year.Without realizing it, I was feeling judgmental towards Tony and even wondering if he might’ve had a minor stroke because it just felt to me like he was checking out. So we haven’t been tested yet, but I think both of us have some hearing loss.  On occasion, I climb with a friend who just has such a soft voice, and I can’t understand a word he says. I mean, nothing. Because of all the great posts here if it turns out one or both of us need hearing aids, I’m gonna feel fine about that.As always I am also looking to the nutritional strategies, and I always feel that if something offers even a 10% improvement then it’s worth it. So with vision I have been taking a version of AREDS which includes lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin, Zeaxanthin, and some actual vitamin A, and it has almost eliminated my dry eye and improved my vision so far about 25%.  I also now take 3 to 4000 units of omega-3’s and having read the pros and cons of doses that high I still think overall it’s the way to go.There’s less nutritional information on hearing loss, but there is some and I am reviewing it as we speak. eastern medicine views hearing as related to the kidneys. One type of hearing loss is related to aldosterone and sodium balance—which can also go awry with illness. Of all the trial and error in the past few years for me the keepers have been various ancestral supplements, and a few key nutrients, but right now I am honed in on “food”. I don’t think there’s a pill that can replace very intentional nutrition.

Look for a hearing and balance place that works with everybody, of all ages.That's who I was referred to, and insurance pays for this level of service. I've gone to both the hearing and the balance side, and it's very thorough. Also quite interesting!If you want a fun easy way to try this out, go to a place where they can let you try out bone induction headphones and listen to some music. I have an in ear hearing aid, but bone induction was an option too, and, even the headphones for music work with my deaf side. Pretty cool, and pretty inexpensive too, compared to hearing aids. 80, 100 bucks maybe??H.

My Wife has some hi-tech German ones! She uses her IPHONE to control and adjust them. She gets phone calls through them, map directions through them while driving. She can tune them so she can “listen in” to coworkers conversations  or tune them out depending on the settings. So good luck with the audiologist visit.Let me ask you something about your inability to figure and identify routes. Do you have Randy’s excellent guide books? If not you need a copy of Joshua Tree West. When I look for a climb I identify the formation, then identify a can’t miss climb- “knee ripper, 5.8 a 9 inch crack”… so the “generic grain faceclimb 5.10a” you’re looking for is 6 climbs to the left of “knee ripper”. Just look and understand the climbs as described in the book- if one of the climbs is noted as having 4 bolts confirm that one then id the climbs to each side etc. Do not rely on Mountain Project ever! I was at Manure Pile, in the Valley, and MP does not even show 1/2 of the climbing roots! Don’t use select guides ever - you will be hopelessly lost. Bottom line- JT is where people learn how to find climbs, based on root descriptions. And you might want to go into a gun shop and purchase a “range finder” … Randy’s books use yards- example “walk 300 yards west and turn right into a corridor, scramble over the back of it and you will see “the black blob boulder” 500 yards out- head towards it and “favorite generic faceclimb 5.10a” is 200 yards beyond… if you can’t judge distance (I can after being a golfer and a target shooter for a long time) get one.The major league of finding a climb is when you go to the Mountains, Red Rocks or Shuteye, now that’s a challenge and a test of your skills.All us old climbers will remember the old guide books- the Roper Guide comes to mind. Written descriptions are very handy! If it says scramble up a 80 foot low angle right facing dihedral with a few bay trees and you know you have not scrambled up and you haven’t seen bay trees….. you are lost. Happy climbing all!

 Hi Colden. Looks like you're back down in the Kenai? Weather looks clear but I bet it's starting to get cold!A few posts back you mentioned you have a cabin at the Funny River. Just so happens that one of my favorite fishing holes on the Kenai is near the Funny River confluence. Back in 2016 I caught this monster pink salmon there. It was certified as the International Game Fish Association catch and release world record (all-tackle length).Now that’s a humpy! Looks to be in pretty good shape for making it up to Funny River. Must have been a blast to catch. Beautiful time of year on the Kenai. Drove through Cooper Landing this morning on the way to ANC. Birches are gold on the hillsides with a little fresh snow on the peaks. Winter’s coming fast!

I will ‘second’ Guy’s comments about identifying routes—in Joshua Tree and elsewhere. For those unfamiliar with the area, Randy’s books for J.T. are virtually a necessity ( when I made my visits it was only one book for the entire, at that time, Monument). As Guy wrote, in a complex area such as that selected guides are of little help and, for most places, MP is even worse.I can also attest to the challenges of finding routes at Shuteye—-my ‘thrashing’ to actually climbing ratio there was very much on the negative side—even with a good guidebook ( and was even significantly worse at Calaveras !!!). Though, for some reason, I seem to have done well in that regard in Red Rocks.Concerning the old school guidebooks, I think one of the ‘ standouts’ was the AAC book for the Canadian Rockies, where a not untypical description would be “Climb east face to summit”. More than one party successfully followed a route description from that book and once on top discovered that they’d climbed a different mountain. Ah, the good old days!!!

Thank you so much, Brandt. That’s a yes from me! I really appreciate it.Guy and Alan,  I do have Randy‘s great guide book. I didn’t realize mountain project had such a bad reputation. But for someone who is so directionally challenged I’m really proud of myself: I finally know the 4 directions by smell and I’m still careful but I haven’t gotten lost in a long time.  I push a little further on difficult terrain as I commit it to memory. I’d also like to find Compassion of Elephants.  I have hiked back there 4 or 5 times but between the overgrown manzanita and oak and shrubs the base of the entire wall is mostly inaccessible.  I “think” I’ve found it but what I spotted could be any one of a handful of routes.  Honestly, this is really fun.  My way of learning my new home.  Sometimes I feel like Miss Jane.

Thx Greg. Yes a topo is nice on long routes. One of the better books I've seen (ST Tuol.select) had a photo w partial overlay, a hand drawn topo more complete, and some adjectival info. Pretty easy to cross reference, consistent left to right. No flipping the book over or paging around. Some books try to do too much. Big glossy pics, tiny squiggly topos . . .I enjoy MP. After climbing at least. Get home try and find where you've been. Comments, gear lists etc. can be useful or way off. Less polished data bases can be funky to navigate. Nothing beats experience. Someone familiar or eyes that say, "that looks good."

Even at my local crags MP all too frequently more wrong than right, and, almost invariably incomplete.

On the subject of hearing loss for climbers, I've had one of those moments when karma comes back to bite you in the ass.  For many years, I heaped scorn and derision on people who used walkie-talkies for climbing communication.  Now in my hearing-impaired dotage, I've had to embrace that technology.  Although I wear my hearing aids for ordinary outdoor pursuits, I take them out for roped climbing.  Not only can certain rope motions knock them out, but leader falls and other sharp impacts can too.  I think my aids were 2 or 3 thousand, I've actually blocked the amount, and if they're knocked out of your ears on a climb, you'll never see them again. (I do have insurance for them but am not sure if it really works.)  So the hearing aids come out and a walkie-talkie gets clipped to my harness. (Note: I'm aware of various types of hearing-aid leashes but haven't gone that route.)To add further to my comeuppance, I have to grudgingly admit that walkie-talkies simplify a host of climbing situations, eliminating confusion, uncertainty, and misunderstanding. No more screaming unanswered commands into the wind, or trying to manage a "situation" when out of voice contact.   A number of people I've climbed with, forced to carry one of my walkie-talkies because of my condition, have decided after a day or two of using them to buy their own, and not because they have any hearing issues.

 Yes, I need a life.Interesting story about that wall... a load of years ago, probably on one of the first times I ever climbed in the Monument, we were wandering around Steve Canyon looking at routes, and for some reason, I decided Deflowered (5.6) looked like a fun time. So I racked up and fired the route. A friend came up behind me, cleaning gear, when she got to a 3.5 Friend somewhere in the upper part of the crack. And it was stuck. Like hopelessly stuck. Being a time when I had just assembled a lead rack that actually contained some camming units, I was not happy. Once she got to the top, I rapped down to see if I had any better luck. Yup, it was stuck. But I wasn't taking "stuck" for an answer, so while she waited patiently for me, I ran back to my nearby car and got a hammer and a big screwdriver. Returning, I reclimbed back up to the cam and proceeded to pound it out of the crack a quarter inch at a time. The screwdriver left notches in the holes of the cams where I was pounding on them, but I was getting that thing out of there (it was just going to be garbage left in the crack if I couldn't get it out - bad form). Eventually, I got it back out and it went home with me. I probably still have it around here somewhere... On trips back into Steve Canyon to climb other things over the years, I've looked at Deflowered in the intervening years and it looks sorta semi-wide and burly... but I was young, had big hands, and liked that kind of thing back then. I'm much more refined now. Ha ha ha ha!! Good story. I remember having similar situations, heading back to the car for tools, to retrieve the old rigid friends, but mostly with the 1" size. It seemed that the 1 inch friend was designed to get stuck. I still have at least one mangled one laying around somewhere.Regarding Decompensator of Lhasa. It's of little consequence, since all of the real climbing is above the mid-point, but I think the funnest start is to do "G" up to the horizontal and traverse left to "F." Also, Randy can set me straight here, but wasn't the "G" version the original route, with a belay on top of the pinnacle before the higher traverse out left?

Waking up this morning to watch the brutal invasion by Hamas, and the retaliation by Israel, it seems wrong to do anything but stay tuned and pray. I am sure that there are some documentaries on this history that would fill in some gaps for me. My best friend – – the one who used to be so liberal – – texted me and asked if I thought maybe God was just angry at all this disruption by Palestine. Yes, I imagine God is hurt and pissed, but not for the reason she thinks.——I’ve been thinking about Carl and would love an update. I saw that there was a death in his area.—-So I was out climbing with Bob yesterday, and it has been suggested I could use a little gym work out.  I’d have to say it was my worst day ever on the rock and certainly worrisome. When things don’t go well I’m always asking myself “is this an aging thing?”. I really don’t think so but I am learning that we must have a huge helping of self-love and patience just to keep trying.I know how hard Bob and others have preached on “hips to wall“ and the theory that hips-in takes weight off of arms. So I was really trying to observe as I was climbing exactly why I have a problem with this.  And it comes down to poor technique, but mainly lack of strength in my arms and fingers. In no time I just didn’t have the strength in my upper body to pull up and my fingers slid right off of slopers and even some decent holds. And I’m sure it would also take some work on my low back to arch backwards the way Bob has instructed.I thought that at least some of the time I did have my hips to the wall but when Bob said “that means your belly button should be touching the rock“ it was like… Dang! I can’t do that!It’s almost like overhung climbing is a whole different sport. Crack climbing is it own thing. I mean how many years do we have?  I never wanted to say I only do a slab and have to run from every other kind of rock. But maybe to be a “well rounded climber“ is a fading possibility.I came home hungry. I really wanted a steak and that’s a bad idea in this area because the only option really is Applebee’s. Sizzler packed up and left town a long time ago. There’s a place called Pappy and Harriet‘s. That was beloved at one time but something has happened I guess with the new ownership and it seems they randomly throw people out, and sometimes quite rudely. I don’t understand the reluctance to allow better restaurants and food chains into the area, with millions of people passing through every year one would think an In-N-Out, or a nice restaurant would be a good thing.

It was frozen solid, but a few applications of WD-40 and it was working smoothly again.

Of course technique matters, but I find it a bit of a joke when folks go on about technique on vertical or overhanging rock.  There's now an entire climbing industry whose entire point is to help you get stronger---for a fee.  I think people manage to confuse conditions that mathematicians refer to as "necessary" and "sufficient."  Strength is almost never sufficient to get you up something, but once the rock gets steep enough strength (and endurance) is going to be necessary for success no matter where your damn belly button goes. Mostly the necessary strength is hand strength and endurance; people who can hang on can indeed trump the need for upper body strength with technique.  But your hands are the tires on the vehicle.  It doesn't matter how big an engine you've got if the wheels are coming off.  My little gym climbing group is mostly women.  They all climb harder than me.  Technique is a part of this, but mine ain't half bad.  They can hang on longer and pull harder, that's the main point, and the fact that I am in an almost different world in terms of superior upper body strength doesn't help me at all.  Another aspect of hand strength is the rich get richer phenomenon.  You can't apply good technique on steep rock if you're pumping out, so good technique requires a base of strength in order to be accessible when things get steep.  You need good technique to solve the physical challenges, but you need strength to allow you to apply the good technique.I might have missed it in the comments here, and in any case it applies more to gym climbing, but getting the hips in on steep rock is often accomplished by climbing "sideways," meaning a lot more use of the outside boot edges than we do on slabs.  It's not the belly button as much as the butt cheek that needs to get in close.  A lot of old-timers like me had to learn this in their golden years, since we didn't do it that much on the kinds of pitches we mostly climbed BITD.

As usual, you're spot on!Here's a little excerpt from my book Advanced Rock Climbing, on steep face climbing:"Regarding hips being close to the wall," says Wills Young, "a point to understand is that when resting on face climbs, the hips need to be over the feet. But you need to create space between the hips and the wall, if possible, before you make your next move. As you move, you drive your hips toward the wall. This is critical, as a beginner mistake on big moves is to start a big movement with their hips very close to the wall. From that position, the movement/trajectory of center of gravity can only be outward."HIP ROLLIf your hips are facing the wall, you're limited on how far you can reach up with one arm. For extended moves, you can gain a few inches by turning one hip into the wall. If you're reaching up with your left arm, turn your left hip into the wall. You'll be able to reach several inches higher than if both hips are parallel to the wall. The opposite hand can be pulling straight down on a hold, or on a sidepull. If you're reaching up with your left hand, the left foot will naturally want to be positioned on the outside edge of the shoe.

I’m working my way through V4/5 and 5.11 along with a few 5.12 in the gym, and I thought the same thing as you “power and endurance”.However, there’s a lot more than hand strength involved here. V6 may require a bit more hand strength, but most of the ladies I know climb with technique. The weight is distributed well amongst all points of contact. It’s not strength that keeps them up. It’s mostly “leverage” and the skill to maximise it.I’m just starting to learn to use skill. It’s the first time in my life being on climbs that are up to 60 degrees negative incline, and it takes skill to get there.You may be correct above V7 or V9, 5.13b, but V5/6 are very much skill centric.

October has always been my favorite time of year here in Joshua Tree. This year has been especially nice so far. I've been getting out pretty often with a bunch of different partners. A few photos from yesterday evening:M & M Peanut, 5.10a or b; I fell my way up this but think I worked it out so I could do it next time.  A nice evening on the way back to the car.

It is beautiful out Brandt! So nice to see you Climbing. I still think about that time I had Tony pull off the road so we could watch a climber on a formation next to echo rock I believe. We watched for the longest time and then I realized the climber was you!   I really appreciate what rgold wrote yesterday. Especially on the routes I was climbing Monday. It was my fingers that gave out first not only in strength, but my skin was not tightened up at all. When we moved here there was a climbing gym not that far away, and my intention was to be there a couple of times a week. It closed almost the week we got here, and so there’s been none of that upper body workout. Fingers and forearms – – they gotta be strong.  I guess I was starting to feel sort of invincible on slab, and really got spanked on the vertical and overhanging routes.I was thinking of this “Zen“ thing, and trying to understand why I don’t get the Zen feeling when I’m climbing. Then I realized I most certainly do on slab, and that may be why I seek it out.  This morning I hiked out just to keep an eye on the elephant route, but also to swing by CS special again. I think the reason I love these routeso much is because they do put me in a zone. I block out everything else and just go.I took a long look at this weird huge flake again and I think I see the route now. I will have to check this out later, but it looks like you would step onto the face from the boulder to the left. Unless you could levitate, I don’t see a good start from the ground.I am pretty sure I have found the compassion of the elephants route, but every time I go it is even more overgrown. It’s a really hard to get anywhere back there.Here is CS special from a profile and I know Jan advised if I liked that I would like an eye for an eye and a route for a route even more, and I did.  I had another VERY close encounter with a rattlesnake last week.   I was directed to this Facebook site, which seems to offer a wealth of information on snakebites by a team of doctors, however, this particular post freaked me out. My main question has been what to do if I am a half hour or more away from my car and I’m bitten. I thought I had a plan. But it turns out that the danger varies with the type of rattlesnake and I don’t know enough to tell the difference. The” timber rattlesnake“ looks like it can be pretty deadly pretty fast. So I’m trying to get more information on the Mojave greens.Their protocol is to elevate the limb 45° and never keep it below chest level, which is the opposite of anything I had heard, but their rationale is to try to limit swelling. Also, no NSAIDs, no Cortizone or prednisone, no Benadryl, no aspirin – – basically nothing until you get to the ER and it was a little discouraging to hear that even hospitals in the vicinity of rural areas like ours may have no clue of the best practice for treating bites.

To answer your question:  If you get bit, you can sit there until you die or until help arrives and they tell you that you're going to die, or you can walk out and maybe die.

The title of this thread caught my eye and compelled me to read the OP, which I found response-worthy on two points. Admittedly, I have not read through any of the other posts here, but I suspect there has been lots of input from other "climbers over 50".The OP shared a quote from Chris Sharma, which I completely agreed with. Those of us that have been in the game for a while can recall when Chris came onto the scene as a boy, astounding the climbing world with his skills right from the start. It almost seems inconceivable that Chris is rapidly approaching being among we "climbers over 50". To be sure, Chris's experiences are deep, and not without their share of drama. In my upcoming book, I share a SAR event that I was involved in back in the late 90's.....a rescue of Chris and partner Sterling Keene, on the eastern Sierra back country classic formation, Incredible Hulk. Chris was considered the best climber in the world at the time, so this story really shows that all of us, no matter our skill sets, can find trouble out there, and thereby become "experienced".   Beyond that, though, Chris shared how just being out there, no matter what level you're pursuing, makes you a success. I noticed that the OP was posted on September 12....the day I arrived in Zermatt....and 3 days before I celebrated my 62nd birthday in that extraordinary spot. However, I wasn't there to climb. On this trip, I was there as a tourist on a month-long tour covering specific destinations in France, Switzerland and Italy. Though I wasn't climbing, I did get to reconnoiter the areas around Zermatt, then went on from there to Chamonix. This was my first time to these areas, so I left with plenty of information on the logistics of getting over here, and how I'd like to position myself for some long-term trips in the region.All this to say that, what I've found in my 48+ years of climbing is this.....there's even joy in the planning of climbing, not just the climbing itself. Prior to starting to climb at 13 years old in 1975, I read books about the places and climbs that I finally laid eyes on nearly 50 years later, and there is tremendous joy in just that! Just seeing these amazing spots fuels the stoke! And one doesn't have to climb at their limit to be the one having the most fun. Sometimes.....one doesn't even need to be roped up at all.The view of the Matterhorn from my hotel roomA section of Whymper's infamous rope that broke on the first ascent, leading to the four fatalitiesSome items that belonged to members of the team who perishedMy own self in Zermatt....the Matterhorn shrouded in clouds above meIn Chamonix, at the Guide's headquartersMy next goal in Chamonix....Aiguille du Dru

My Colorado partner from BINTD was visiting his parents about 3 hrs south of me so a mini road trip was in order. Packed up the van and headded out monday afternoon. By the time I had picked  Alex up and got to the crag it was dark, cold and windy. We got a few climbs in before last light.sorry about the text changes.. cant figure out how to get the keys to co operate...  I forgot to take photos on the first climb but this is Alex following the 2nd route. the sun came through the clouds just as it was going down. cool sunset and hiked down in the dark. somehow i managed to stubb my big toe in a nasty way that separated my big toenail from the flesh.... I spent a rather cold night in the van in their driveway.  A lazy start  to the day had us driveing around NH in circles through rain showers trying to find a dry crag. Eventually we ended up at Rummy.  I led one climb and it just was not fun. Toe hurt too much. sock was full of blood. Alex who had not been on a rope since last year led the next two.last night was warmer and I am well rested.  We helped Alexe's dad tinker on his 71 Jag for a bit.then I headed back up here and tried with no luck to get Blue Bessie Running. there was a nasty mouse nest between the battery tray and the ignition wires and plugs. No luck. i could not get that plug out. i brought  20gl air tank out in the field and got that mess cleaned up pretty good but not enough room for my plug wrench to fit down in the head... I can get a chincy  lawnmower style plug wrench on it but cant get enough force to do the trick ...   more suffering tomorrow...

Out mountain biking one of the local trails. Something happens and he wrecks into a bush that happened to have a rattlesnake. He gets bit. News said he walked out (~30 minutes) and transported himself to the hospital and was recovering.If you have no dependable help on the way… sitting there seems sorta pointless.it was a little discouraging to hear that even hospitals in the vicinity of rural areas like ours may have no clue of the best practice for treating bites.I’d guess the local medical center sees its share of bites and is prepared to handle them. Assuming otherwise makes no sense. You can always call and ask if you’re worried about it.

I kept looking at this creature and trying to figure out why it had fins. (Yesterdays gar is not the one this gentleman is holding below.)also, I am sure that news of a bigger fish than salmon will trigger Bob and he’ll feel like he has to go set some kind of record catching gar.re snake gaiters… not a bad idea. So far the snakes I’ve encountered have been very cordial, if also a little irritated that I traipse through their living rooms. I just wanted a game plan for “what if”…Russ kind of spelled it out in his supportive way, namely get the hell out of dodge.  Don’t sit in place and die. EDIT: Hey Dean!  Welcome!  I’m glad you liked the quote from Sharma.  What I liked about it was his saying that if you try hard, no matter the outcome, you are “the best climber in the world “.  And somehow I know he’s right… there will never be another “you” or your body of experience and wisdom.  For so many older climbers here, each climber is irreplaceable and each outing continues to build character and skill.  (imho).

Stay with us, Dean! And call when you’re in the area.I had one of the best climbing days I’ve ever had yesterday and am at a loss to explain it. Everything about it made me happy and yet it’s a route I will never complete. I have wanted onto that rock for years, by hook or crook, and Bob graciously indulged me (after many warnings and disclaimers).I know there’s more appropriate rocks for me. And I’m sure I will return to more sensible climbing. But not yesterday and I still might go back for more.  This rock has a hard start, and I would have been happy if I could have just gotten off the ground more graciously. But then you’re looking at a vertical 10+ crack. It requires much more crack technique than I have but also I kept thinking about rgold’s comments – – you gotta have muscle. Bob, reminding me constantly that my butt was hanging out and yet if I am losing my grip on a hold then I am just sinking into the horizon. We have discussed the need for some gym work.   I got to experience a perfect jam on that crack that fit Bob‘s hand perfectly, but mine kept sliding out. When we added some tape to my index finger it just added enough width that I could hold.There’s a couple of key nubbins along the way, and I broke one of them Once you are through the worst of the crack you move to the left and start moving up smaller buttresses. At a certain point – – and it has to be precise – – you step onto the first face, which is absolutely vertical with no features so you can’t even smear or edge, but have to grab a horizontal 6 feet above and pull up. That horizontal is probably too tall for me and Bob says it will be out of my reach, which I do not accept.  If you get through that, you are then facing the biggest challenge, which is actually the beginning of Trix, and that is to muscle over the overhang, and onto the very top part of the formation. That’s the part I will likely never do—but again, I do not have to accept that as doctrine.Why work on a route with so many impossibilities? I don’t know. What I know is I am packing on muscle fast, and learning fast, I am seeing those key moves in my sleep, and my body is finally pulling itself out of the yearlong crisis. So that’s why. As usual yesterday I did not see another soul in this place where there is a bounty of heaven. Bob setting it up for me. Had to stop and take a picture of these cool little buttresses on the left side. I get a little nervous jamming a foot into some of these deep cracks. What happens if you cannot pull said foot out of the crack?I suspect it will be the same story for all four routes that I have chosen for this season, but it will be a joy to work up to them and climb easier routes that have similar qualities.

Lori Milas.....I scanned through a few posts back and saw you bring up the Steve Canyon route, 'Decompensator of Lhasa'....thought I'd share a funny story about that climb.In 1981, about a year after that route was established, I got a brand new pair of Fires from Bachar. They were literally right out of the box, and I took them into Steve Canyon. I was climbing with Tim Wagner then....we were both really young. I slapped on those bad boys and led up Decompensator....it felt a full number grade easier than it did when I climbed it months prior in EB's. So at the top, I lower the Fires down to Tim so he can give them a test drive. Tim starts climbing and is just cruising....I'm yarding in rope. Very quickly he's at the business....without hardly a pause. Suddenly, I hear Tim yell up the wall at the top of his lungs......"FIRES ARE GOD!!!!!!!!!"

Lori, feet and hands go in....then reverse that to take them out. What's a bit more problematic are joints, because they change shape when bent, or even weighted. Thus, knees seem to be the main stuck part, or, for me, the one that feels like it's gonna be a problem. For me, it's stuff the biggest bit that'll go, wherever it can be stuffed, lol! But my crack experience is very limited, and I'm a pretty bad climber in general. Fingers in pockets can be scary, too. And hands on sharp edges. And ....H.

Advice for when you do get stuck (and yes, it happens to experts too). https://climbingzine.com/so-you-got-your-knee-stuck-by-kaya-lindsay/I've gotten my knee stuck once (on Wendy, in Yosemite, more than 50 years ago).  I did it in the usual way, with a very small unplanned downward slip.  My case was especially bad, because I was wearing knickers with a metal fastening buckle, and that buckle cammed behind a knee bone the way a ball nut cams on the "paddle.". I was extremely fortunate not to have placed the only bong I had for that size, so I was able to drive it overhead and with a lot of effort over what seemed like forever winch myself up a fraction of an inch and so unlock the knee.As for Mark Hudon, I don't think so, but in 1976 Martin Boysen got his knee stuck at 20,000 feet on the Great Trango Tower and nearly died trying to get it out. His only bong was unreachable below him at the time.

ANOTHER point in favor of steep slab. You do not have to abandon body parts along the way   As I was working my way up those columns of rocks and trying to get a good foot jam I lost my grip and fell—more like a short swing.  My foot didn’t immediately come with me and I knew I had twisted my knee from the jolt. So that’s the second time that I have fallen on a route with my foot wedged in a crack and the only times that I really thought I might be injured. I woke up with a throbbing knee last night and just grateful it’s only a strain.I guess this is a reminder that climbing can be a little dangerous. I think the problem lies in the comparison between lead climbing and mountaineering with toproping single pitches – – so toproping appears to be hazard free. As with so much else on my journey, I am reminded to use my own judgment and not assume I am safe despite my intuition that I’m not.It’s easy to be lulled into a sense of complacency when it’s “only top roping“ and in such a controlled environment with a guide or very experienced friend. I don’t know if anyone ever dies. But it wouldn’t be difficult to break an ankle or come to other kinds of harm.If I may add one more word here it’s the frustration I sometimes feel over those words “just top roping“. I have never worked so hard in my life, and I realize I am still a weak climber, not in my prime, but there is nothing “just“ about it. But what I do love is observing along the way what you climbers did on lead or solo and it’s mindblowing. So I guess compared to what most of you did BITD toproping is just a polka. But relative to my LazyBoy friends, or even my gym-climbing friends, it is heroic.This is my meditation station, but when I am not meditating, I try to imagine what Russ and others accomplished on this rock. But that perfect slab to the right is mine.(some day)    Guy, you’re back! Why aren’t we getting trip reports? Holding out?Dean, great story! I can only assume that fires were a few iterations before what we have today which boggles my mind. It’s proof to me that I was meant to climb as TC pros came out just about the same time as my first steps onto rock.  It’s probably a true sign from God, because had I not had the gift of incredible shoes I would’ve just had to take a pass on the whole thing. You guys were studs.

Some personal opinions on TRing:1) You can get hurt on TR. Mostly mine stuff, but I've read about a few broken bones. Maybe a death (while climbing, not during rap or cleaning), but can't remember specifically. But most TR accidents (during the climbing phase) I have read about or seen were due to improper belaying.2).I have no problem with TRing a route. Yesterday I did 15 climbs; I TRed 7 of them.  I have already led 6 of those, so I had nothing to prove to myself.  Yes, the mental aspect is a bit easier, but the movement is just as fun, although perhaps a tad different sometimes without having to clip.

I was extremely fortunate not to have placed the only bong I had for that size, so I was able to drive it overhead and with a lot of effort over what seemed like forever winch myself up a fraction of an inch and so unlock the knee.As for Mark Hudon, I don't think so, but in 1976 Martin Boysen got his knee stuck at 20,000 feet on the Great Trango Tower and nearly died trying to get it out. His only bong was unreachable below him at the time.Mark-Martin…potato-potato

I just want to make a pitch for this Farm Stand. It is pricey but many are less so… but once you’ve paid for it it’s low cost going forward.  You can grow from seed or buy starts.  You can have a year round steady stream of veggies without much hassle.  Right now I have 5 different types of lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, bok choi, chives, thyme, enough basil to make pesto, arugula, zinnias and marigolds.  More good news, I’ve gotten to know Lisa at the farmers market who is very busy in her kitchen.  She said she picked these apricots in Landers.  She has grown apricots and plums here in J Tree.  These brandied apricots are great!  Brandt, any luck growing fruit trees?  Russ?

Some years back our apricot tree would be filled with fruit. We made more jelly than we could eat. A couple of years ago it stopped bearing much fruit. Don't know why. Old age? Disease? Anyway, it's still a nice looking tree.

As to fruit trees, no, I don't really have any.  I got some figs going over the last couple of years and they are producing a good amount.  I have friends who live right up the street from Brandt that have/had a mini orchard that really was kicking out the apricots and plums.  Lots of jelly and preserves made from their trees.  Some of those trees died, and I'm not sure why.  Some sort of borer I believe.  My next fruiting experiment will be with lime trees.  Maybe get it started this winter/spring.

Well, this is a problem. If I thought I could grow a plum tree here my life would be complete. Normally I  would swing by the local nursery but the only one I know of in Yucca Valley. The owner seems to be high most of the time. Now I never see him at all and the place has truly gone to seed.  Home Depot could get their act together and have some knowledgeable information but when I go there, which is frequently, they have never had a solid person who knew anything about gardening.This area seems to have microclimates and special bugs in each area.  I wouldn’t know what to do with a weevil. I will bet Helen could figure this out.  Everything is so fucking hard!

Go down to the nurseries in Palm Springs to find decent fruit trees.  I had an apricot tree (probably my favorite fruit) but the squirrels at all the fruit long before it was ripe so I chopped it down.

I have found that protecting the trunks of stone fruit trees from sun is paramount to their survival in the Mojave Desert. Those that I have planted where the sun shines on the trunk in the winter when the leaves have fallen have all succumbed to borer damage. The ones that were planted between a wall and the house have been going well for quite some time. The house and walls shade the plum and apricot trunks when there is no protection from the foliage. Wrapping the trunks is also recommended. Fig trees don't seem to be affected. They are pretty tough, as long as it doesn't freeze too hard. Pomegranates, on the other hand, do exceptionally well without much effort.

It’s a real challenge to plant non-native plants here and I’m not even sure we should try. I can’t think of a spot in my yard that would provide shade for a large tree during the winter. Also, the thing about buying plants in Palm Springs is that area is pretty close to sea level and never gets a freeze and we’re around 3200 feet here and get frequent freezes for a couple of months.One of my favorite plants is bougainvillea, which thrives year-round in Palm Springs but I know from experience that it will die in any kind of freeze, unless you baby it and wrap it every year and even then.One of the hardest things for me to leave in Sacramento was my plum tree. One year I harvested over 400 pounds black plums, and they were so sweet and juicy and we canned for weeks. Our farmers market here is expensive and I’m just not coming home with great tasting stuff so Maybe I will find a hearty variety of stone fruit and give it a go. Best of luck to Russ on the lime.——I was browsing through all the data on WHOOP wearers this morning, and I’m still fascinated with what shows up on my WHOOP. I thought I would be over it along time ago, but it is the most useful tool I have for exercise and recovery.  During months of insomnia last year, I was able to measure and fix the problem with a lot of persistence and data. It’s kind of mind-boggling how predictive it is.Prior to Whoop, I don’t think I had ever heard of HRV, heart rate variability. Now it’s a thing. As much as I’ve read, I still don’t understand it all but these various metrics measure and track exercise and recovery And just a baseline well-being. This morning I checked in on the WHOOP group “women over 60“ and even the best athletes have HRV in the range of 20 to 30. Check in on a similar group of “women in over 30 group” and their HRV‘s are in the range of  70 to 100. I think I read that Alex Honnold‘s HRV is 140.HRV declines with age. Higher is better.  So Alex can go like crazy, fall into a deep sleep, and wake up totally refreshed.So, when you see that your heart rate variability is in the tank, there are good strategies, quantifiable measures, that can bring those numbers up (be more recovered) so that you can go hard tomorrow. If you also journal you can see with your own eyes what’s working and what’s not. Somethings like extra sleep, sauna/cold,  avoidance of alcohol, meditation, vitamin D, more hydration, more electrolytes, weighted blankets… Everyone is different, and some things work better than others. For a non-athlete like me, I have spent a lot of time bewildered by exhaustion, and sometimes an explosion of energy so I’ll take the learning tools available.

Greetings from Idaho:Just started, but there's some nice ones, and a decent amount, so far. At least 5 different varieties, maybe 7? Yukon, russet, red, rose, purple....but then some of them vary by yellow, white, or purple flesh, also. That's what makes it so fun to grow your own, here. Farmers market will have more than the stores do, but even then, it isn't anywhere near the varieties that are out there. And, there's whole categories I don't bother with, like fingerlings.And, for Guy:They aren't dry yet, but soon! So any hot heads who want some Thai chilis, send me a mailing address.H.EDIT to add, and it's apple time, too!

One of my friends the other day was saying that trad climbing interrupts the ‘flow’ of climbing. I replied that if you want to fully ensure an uninterrupted flow you’d top rope and not lead at all. He was not impressed. He said top roping was ‘crap’. I disagree. As I get older I’m finding I’m turning in to a top roping gym junkie. I even top roped two routes (grade 5.10a, 5.10b) at Arapiles which is a world class trad destination, and I’m perfectly fine with that. I NEVER climb hard on trad, so the opportunity to pull hard on a route couldn’t be missed.

I always have more fun TRing routes at Indian Creek after leading them without enough of the same sized cams.

I have to admit, I don’t browse other topics very often. It’s become a morning habit to grab my cup of coffee and spend a few minutes on this thread to catch up with the conversation and to move on. But as for Climbing news I sure do seem to get the information when it happens including accidents, and injuries.    Kind of related (maybe not  ) I saw a writer refer to this phase of his life as “The Fourth Act”. That really caught my attention, because I saw this time of my life as a very extended Third Act. The kids are grown and business is finished, and now you have decades to do something different. But I really like the idea of a distinctive fourth act that has its own unique characteristics. So I’m running with it. In fact what I think this really is is a lengthy third and fourth act thread.It was a huge relief for me to cross the number 70 threshold and get on some rock. So lightning didn’t strike and I climbed something hard, and suddenly it feels as though these years will be their own special thing.Bob sent me a great link to a expose by John Long on the Stonemasters (maybe Bob can post it here again) but I was struck by John’s melancholy over that special era drawing to a close and the whole tribe drifting apart. Obviously I have nostalgia for that special time and I wasn’t even there.  Suddenly, I realized, wait! The history of this place is important to me, but it certainly doesn’t have to represent loss. Climbing today on toprope, and having the adventure of my life doesn’t make it less than whatever was going on 50 years ago. And also, you don’t have to climb to be a climber. Whatever soul quality compelled you to rock is still there. I suspect that Guy is having an incredible Fourth Act, along with Jan…. Kris is well underway for a new phase of life and I’m so excited for him. Rgold has tried to express his view and appreciation of this time of life and I’m not sure I totally got it until now. I was a little clearer on the special phase of life we were in in the late 60s, a little less so now, but I think if only we had the perspective of hindsight, we would see how remarkable we all are.My best friend is in the hospital and I don’t know whether she will come out. She only has one remaining kidney and now she has a massive kidney infection. It’s possible if she does get discharged she will need to be here with us for however long and that will be a privilege. My sister-in-law just broke her hip and may not leave the hospital. My brother is about to turn 90 and has been asked if he would come back as a Eucharistic minister and I think he’s considering it. And there’s 2 wars. There’s a lot of need out there. So I don’t quite have this whole fourth act thing worked out because now there is a lot of pain and a lot of need and we’re all gonna die.  But maybe not today.And I forgot to mention Sumo Wrestling.

Valentino was a champion yesterday. He got to Stoney at 6:30, set up some TR’s on Beethoven. My favorite! People started showing up at 7:30 - the REI guides showed up at about 9 and asked us to leave!?!?!? “No dice dudes”… “but you are welcome to come take a run”.Lori… you almost never ever need to stick a foot way deep into a crack. And thinking about “how to eject” is important!  There is a climb on “Wall of Biblical Fallacies”…. “Blood of Christ” 11-12 something… you get your ring finger into a hole with an extremely razor sharp bottom edge and then transfer your feet to minuscule edges as you go across. If you blow your feet (as I did) your finger gets trapped and cut deeply. Blood everywhere! Tell Bob you want to try that one.—————————————————————Russ- Limes really? I live where it only gets freezing for about 15 minutes per year… perfect for Limes and such. Good luck

It’s just so baffling and intriguing to look at a blank rock and decide to climb it. There are times when I look at even my pictures and think “how was this possible”?  Watching Bob move up steep slab is a little intimidating. I just want to stand back and gawk.  Not sure yet the name of this route… 10a. (I’m guessing Anthony?) The U2 song The Fly is perfect for this kind of rock. It’s just magic. Can it get more magical still? Can I levitate?Speaking of magic… Tony’s cooking marinara.

It's been really fun (so far) having goals for the year.  Each climb has its own challenges.  It's ok with me if I never get there... but it's fun to try.  Bob said that top section of Trix will require a full pull up and press down onto a ledge.  Rather than take it off my list, I'll just see how close I can get with some gym work.But slab. I don't know how it happens. It's perplexing.  I just want to know how far I can take it.  (How about Cleopatra... some day?) I've been chuckling over "climbing the Nose".  That would be the nose on the Sphinx...

After hiking and browsing many parts of this park this year, I have really enjoyed checking things out without a guidebook just to see what I see. So I had eyeballed this rock from every side but the approach is a little risky for me, so I was happy when Bob suggested we go.I am still trying to understand the grading here in Josh.  The first five or six moves off the deck are tough but the rest of the rock is easier. But what if every move on a 100 foot route was like the first few moves on Cesar? Then I doubt I would get very far. I’d like to go back to King Dome, and revisit Tiptoe to Topanga because my recall was that it was relentless and without a break. At the halfway mark I was begging for mercy. And yet I think they are graded nearly the same.if ever there were Zen on rock, slab would be it for me.

Lori, To partially respond to your questions about grading.First, it is not uncommon ( at least in certain areas) to ‘not count’ the first moves on a route as part of the grade. I’ve never understood why this is the case, but it definitely occurs. Additionally, it is also common, especially on popular routes, that the ground at the base is subject to considerable erosion, which can make the starts significantly harder. Of course, climbers being climbers, it is rare for this to be acknowledged in terms of an increase of the grade.As for your thoughts about grading disparities between routes with a single brief crux and those with more sustained difficulties. This has long been one of the major conundrums of the US ( and many other) grading system. ‘Officially’, in the YDS the technical grade of the climb/pitch is supposed to based based on the hardest single move, but, as you recognize, a sustained series of moves of a given difficulty, or even slightly easier, will seem and, in fact, be, harder than a climb with a brief crux section. In fact, in many situations, the actual grades do reflect this differential, but definitely not always.

A simple formula to remember is, a 10a typically has one crux at 10a, a 10d has multiple cruxes at the grade, so on and so forth. Obviously places like IC and the N. east coast are a bit different but its a pretty simple formula for general Yosemite grading.

Lori, you should go get back on EBGBs.  Just grab the first bolt to pull onto the face and do the rest.  I bet you have no problems with the rest of the route.  I was trying to think of like the perfect 11a with no holds that just requires Zen but haven't come up with anything yet without sending you to Suicide Rock.

I feel like 10a should be either techy or a one move wonder. and significantly easier than 9+   It gets thrown off when that one move is 5.11 and I feel thats not in character with 10a. If the one move is 10d or 11ish I go with 9+ otherwise 9+ should be sustained and gnarly.

Back in 2019, I got a crew together and we replaced all the old bolts on Invisible Touch and King Pin (along with all the old bolts in Steve Canyon) with 1/2-inch stainless steel bolts, so these routes are good to go!The bolts on King Pin, in particular, were scary (1/4-inch button heads with rusty Leeper hangers)The new hardware was provided courtesy of the American Safe Climbing Association.If you'd like to donate to the ASCA, check them out at safeclimbing.org

Thank you Alan for trying to clarify the disparity in route grading. I know something about this but still not entirely sure how it works. I would add a third criteria, which is “how badly do I want to climb this thing“  I really wanted to climb Run For Your Life, and my recall is that It just flew by, even the crux. On the other hand, there are some 5.8s that just wear me out.Thank you Jan for your thoughts on EBGBs. It’s one of the very few routes that disappointed me because I screwed it up so badly. Maybe I could go back. There is nothing like a massive wall of pretty much nothing to engage your mind and curiosity. If I were ever able to climb a 5.11 I would want to try Count Dracula. I’m sure you remember it because you were over there putting up that wonderful route, That Old Soft Shoe, with Dave. I have looked at Count Dracula an embarrassing number of times and decided it cannot be done. I’m pretty sure those pictures on mountain project have been photo shopped.   And to think you guys did this routinely and on lead.  And harder. Honestly, it can only be sorcery. I feel like I need to engage with new imagery if I continue my journey on slab. I do picture a fly on a wall.  I just have this hunch that even after we have maxed out on strength and technique any further progress will have to be in the realm of the imaginal. There is no way that a body should stick to a vertical wall except that we will it to do so.Greg, these are marvelous sketching‘s you have done, and I am wondering, did you do this for the whole Park? Thank you for posting these here. I thought I would go have another look at Grain surgery yesterday – – I should’ve called Brandt, but it was on impulse. How could I have failed to see that beautiful slab on sidewinder wall?  I would have put that in my “maybe someday“ category until I saw your sketch and checked Randy’s book but now it’s in the “probably no never“ category. Bummer.

I had a crazy idea, inspired by you lot:This is me trying to explain it to a friend who works at a climbing gym in Poland:Well.  There’s a company, Urban Climb that’s building a climbing gym in Adelaide.They have several gyms in other states. I’m not sure but I think the new gym is bouldering and sports. They have posted on Facebook that they want to hear from Adelaide climbers about the culture and history of climbing in Adelaide. I think I might go to represent older climbers’ interests. I’m sure there’ll be other older people who go to the ‘chat’ as they’re calling it. Basically my idea (I’m sure it’s been done before) is to have a older person squad. Like a youth squad but old peeps. I guess there’s sometimes an assumption that all older climbers have been climbing for decades and know it all. But that’s not necessarily the case. I think a lot of older people are coming to climbing later in life as it’s recognised as being a great exercise for older people due to being whole body low impact activity (esp TRing in a gym). One could do info sessions on relevant health issues, bit of yoga, all with an instructor, one evening a week. New and Experienced Climbers Over 50 Squad. NECO50Squad. You heard it here first. Great marketing idea. I think NECO50Squad sounds really cutting edge, really modern. But the marketing material is a bunch of really old peeps dressed up to look like 1990’s punks, with coloured hair and an attitude etc. “Don’t mess with the NECO50Squad! Every Wednesday from 4:30.‘For ever old, not often bold’New climbers most welcome”

Hi All,I've had a busy Spring and Summer, and haven't been keeping up here, so I'm still catching up on the last two over-50 threads (particularly enjoyed the crabs vs. lobsters debate).  But I thought I'd stop in briefly to share what I've been up to.As some of you may recall, I was sidelined from climbing for a few years due to a combination of covid-lockdown, having a kid, and having a misdiagnosed elbow problem.  I still have a lot of family obligations, but I've solved the elbow issue, and over the last two years I've been slowly and methodically gaining back strength and fitness.  Outside climbing time has been quite limited, but I get to the gym myself once a week, and sometimes get another session of fun climbing over the weekend, and have been doing light hangboarding sessions once per week when I can find the time.Generally any outdoor climbing time I have is with the family, but a few times a year I've taken a day off work and driven up to Rumney with my friend Tall Daryl.  Daryl, like me, has young kids, and has had to curtail his climbing severely, but before kids was a climbing addict.  Unlike me, Daryl was really really strong!  Anyway, this summer he tossed out the idea of a climb at Rumney he knew would catch my eye called White Zombie ( mountainproject.com/route/1…).  My friend Kent saw a video of it and declared "Weird, awkward, and insecure - Love it".  That's the kind of climbing I guess we go for.  Maybe because I'm weird, awkward, and insecure myself?Anyway, Daryl and I took a Friday off this Summer and checked it out.  Wow.  Incredibly physical full-body climbing.  We thrashed ourselves pretty good on it.  Came home with half the skin ripped off our backs, hands, one knee (the left one that fits in a chicken-leg up in the corner) and even foreheads.  And very very happy.  Last Friday we got in a second day on it.  Daryl is still working out tall-guy beta, but after a few more failed goes I sent it!  Very pleased.It's essentially a big bomb-bay chimney - a vee slot that's overhanging about 60 degrees.  Here's a video that shows how steep the climb is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGbQhsLKRzgAnd here's me on it (believe me, it's steeper than it looks, I'm kind of horizontal through most of the video, though I look like I'm standing vertically):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioofbD3i5tY&tIt's been a week since I sent it, and I'm still a bit sore!  And still a bit soar(ing).Hope all of you are well, and after I've caught up on the thread(s) I'll check in with you all some more.Cheers,Gabe O

That would be some serious work/time (Randy can tell you). A lot of guidebook authors don't do topo style drawings anymore. It's just way easier and faster to snap a picture and draw a line on it. The last ten or twelve years, I've been working on mapping most of the park, though. Not sure why, it's just something I do. Sort of my own version of OCD meditative basket-weaving. I don't spend a lot of time on it anymore, I got most of the climbing parts of the park done (always missing stuff) but I still update it when I go to a new area and see additions or corrections to be made.

I count to distract myself from the pain of my woeful lack of aerobic fitness. and I’m sure you are right about the time difference. It’s a mile and a half extra walking, so downhill most of the way, to Pub wall, it’s probably about 35-40 minutes. And I’d guess humans with good knees could get down Central in 10 minutes? It’s infinitely better than it was originally. The locals did a phenomenal job with those wire berms and placing stone stairs.Tomorrow our ringleader wants to climb in Rock Creek.

If there is, remove it. I was having trouble hanging draws on bolts because I also had a carabiner on my harness. So i would try grab a draw but my character was grabbing the biner. If there are only draws on your harness either the left or right arrows will grab you a draw.I'm even more impressed with the game today than I was 10 years ago. The guidebook descriptions of the routes are so good. To me, this is the climbing game that best imitates the feeling of actually climbing. Has everything from gear management to different types of cruxes (technical, powerful, balancy, dynos and deadpoints).This game is legit!

I work in drug safety testing and deal with stability info regularly, and would echo what the earlier poster said entirely. However, it’s extremely likely that the manufacturer is currently testing additional conditions/storage lengths so it’s possible updated stability information will become available. This is usually done on a 3mo, 6mo, 12, 24, etc basis though so it may not be viable to wait and see.

Some cutting-edge medications are “biologics” which are not manufactured the way ibuprofen is, but are instead isolated from living systems like cell cultures or even animals. They can be large, very complex molecules and therefore quite sensitive to temperature. Not to be crude, but you wouldn’t want them to get too warm for similar reasons you wouldn’t want a piece of chicken or fish to sit out warm for too long. I point this out because for this class of medicine, storage might never get to be as simple as it is for chemical drugs like the typical pills and colloids we’re used to.

Inspired by this related thread (What are your sketchiest moments climbing?), what's the sketchiest thing you've SEEN while climbing (as opposed to having done yourself)? Might be something done by others, might be something natural (rockfall, etc.).I'm primarily a gym climber (boo, hiss...) so my story comes from there.During a particularly busy evening, there was at least one birthday party, and scores of non-climbers wishing to try rock climbing. The front desk was momentarily overwhelmed and newbies were grouped together to await orientation.A father-daughter duo decided that they had waited long enough, escaped the orientation group, and attempted to access a top rope route. By the time my partner and I noticed, the girl had gotten about four feet off the ground. The father had clipped the grigri to her harness, and was loosely holding the climber end of the rope.Not quite sure what the father's plan was in the event of a fall, but the lack of self-preservation (kin-preservation?) was astounding.

Dude took the hard way to a high first clip on a sport route because it looked more fun. Instead of a chill clip from a jug he was trying to make a massive reach with mediocre hands and terrible feet and was pumping out and getting Elvis leg 20' above large and sharp obstacles. Thought I was gonna watch a man break his ankles or legs for sure. Fortunately dude bro made the clip. Castle Rock in the Santa Cruz mountains is a constant shit show of new to outdoors gym climbers making all sorts of mistakes. Rapping off of sharp hangers and getting to the top not knowing how to clean an anchor were frequent occurrences back when that was my home crag.

This one is awesome.  You can look the route up for context.  I was somewhere that I know better than to go at this point, but I digress.  The route is The Decameron at NRG.  The route goes up one wall near a broken dihedral, and then you have to do a traverse on pretty thin holds.  Goes at mid 5.10.  I watched the typical group that has one guy that can lead and the rest that are there to ride top ropes.  So Mr. leader guy goes up halfway, hits the crux, then bails.  That's like 5 or 6 bolts up.   He then proceeds to instruct someone in his party to tie into the follower end of the rope, and UNCLIP the draws as he goes up.  So picture this:  Crux quickdraw is now backclipped, and this guy is unclipping every previous quickdraw up to that point where he'll then likely fall on a single backclipped draw on a traverse.  My climbing partner and I tried to talk some sense into the group leader and let him know that danger was already there and injury or death might be imminent.  The guy has the nerve to argue with us.  Luckily, the fledgling climber didn't get all the way to the backclipped draw heard our conversation and demanded to be lowered off at that point.  I shudder to think what would have or could have occurred if we hadn't said anything.  I have roughly a couple dozen accounts that are similar to this, but this one is the most obviously egregious one I can think of.

Despite 95% of my climbing being outside, I haven't seen much that was super sketchy.  In the gym though, yeah.  I saw two college girls top roping and when the belayer was lowering the climber, the belayer held the grigri lever wide open with no hand on the brake strand. Climber proceeds to drop, rapidly. Me and anyone else watching immediately yelled, "take your hand off the grigri!" to which she couldn't compute what we meant.  Thankfully a staff member was close enough to literally sprint over and forcibly take her hand off the grigri which of course caused it to stop the lower and the climber was maybe 8 feet off the deck at that point by the time the rope had stretched and recovered.  Staff member proceeded to take them both out of the gym.

Swan slab (of course). I was scrambling around while trying to avoid the crowds. After a few laps I'm ready to leave, so I hop on my bike. But I notice a shit show in the making, so I stay for some entertainment. I'm sitting back and watching a party on Swan Slab Gulley. After all have TR'd the first pitch, the leader goes back up to clean. To my surprise, she throws the rope down instead of rappelling and then begins to downclimb the pitch. I figured she must be solid but immediately starts shaking and asking for advice on feet/hands. She makes it mostly halfway down when I noticed another party (father belaying a teenage daughter) to the left TR on Grant's crack. I saw them earlier doing a TR off a tree left of Oak Tree with zero gear, so I was surprised to see their rope on Grant's crack. I have no idea how they got it up there, but it's directly througu the rap rings and she's having trouble getting up. As she gets up to the anchor she yells "on belay" and so the dad yells back "off belay" and procedes to take his gri gri off. I quickly run over and let him know that she isn't on the anchor and wants to be lowered. He says thanks and I think about how close that was. I get on my bike to ride away and I hear the daughter yell On Belay again and the Dad starts to take off the gri gri. I honestly thought I was a part of a bit. I run back over as the girl starts to lean back off the anchor and I throw a hip belay on. The dad seems surprised/ confused that im back and I yell at him to put the gri gri back on. He clearly has no idea how to lower so I show him and keep the hip belay as a back up. As the daughter gets down I let them know what almost happened and they seemed totally unphased. I had so much adrenaline that I had to get the hell out of there. Swan Slab man...

Was climbing multipitch with a buddy in upper dream canyon and I was leading. Arrived at an anchor with a guy who was belaying up his second. His second is about halfway up the pitch and I look over to see his grigri side plate completely not clipped in (just the main hole on the grigri, no side plate hole). I point it out to him and he says "yea I know but I can't fix it now". And just holds the side plate in place while his second climbs through the crux. Horrifying to watch.

Years ago I watched a group top-roping of a single piton below the roof on Disneyland in the Gunks. There was also a traverse to get to that piton. We were pretty beginner ourselves but still commented on the questionable safety of what they were doing. They did not want to hear about it.

Saw some marine type dudes setting up TRs on Lizards mouth in SB.  Dude didn't know how to belay as the more experienced person was climbing up high into the get injured zone, was just pulling rope through the belay device and making a big pile of rope on the ground. Not even the remotest belay existed.  We headed over and fixed that before someone leaned back and decked. At smith rock, saw some new, younger climbers leading an 80' 5.10 sport route with 3 quick draws, total. Only noticed them when they were about 50' up when I wondered why the leader was sketchily climbing down and removing the lowest draw, and once removed, was only in on 1 draw a long way off the ground as they climbed above their lone pro piece.. I think he was back cleaning the lower one for every 1 he placed and saving the last for a top anchor?  maybe that sort of would work, but it didn't seem super smart. I walked over, told them to stop climbing for a bit, and gave them 6 of my QDs to keep and use before someone died in front of me. Getting passed by the Huber brothers (back in the day) on Central Pillar of Frenzy as I was on lead several pitches up was also sketchy.  I am not used to getting passed by other trad leaders, and followers, while on a crack climb lead.  Yeah, they are obviously solid, but they only had 1 protection cam in total, and I sure as hell would not trust that I wouldn't  freak out and fall onto their unprotected heads as they climbed below and around me.  They didn't even talk to me and tell me what they were doing, just climbed on by about 100' apart. That was high pressure for about 5 minutes.

Every sketchy incident I've witnessed was in my first year climbing outdoors, all at the RRG, all of them at Muir Valley of course. First incident, we're meeting up with some friends who've been climbing at Bruise Bros and just as we get there, some dude panics, puts his finger in the bolt hole, falls, and amputates it. To make matters worse, he's there on spring break with his college group and they're his ride home, so after returning from the hospital he just sits in the basement at Miguel's for the rest of the week while his friends are all out climbing.Second incident, a day later, I'm belaying my partner and someone's about 15-20' up the trad route to our right. He fails to pull the roof move, pulls the gear, and decks, then rolls down into the forest behind the belay stance. In this case he was miraculously unharmed but that was the last day I ever climbed at Muir Valley.In 5 years at the Gunks I never saw anything even close to that first year in the RRG. Lots of slow, panic-y followers (hey, isn't High E the best 'first outdoor climb' ever?), but everyone was largely safe and competent enough.

Someone leading without any quickdraws or carabiners, by untying, threading the rope end through the ringbolt, then re-tying.Then they went further and climbed under the bolt and rope, so the rope hitched itself to the bolt and was effectively tied off, and every time they tried to climb above it they couldn't pull any rope through.

A belayer was using an atc to belay. The rope was going in one side of the atc and out the other, and the racking loop (the skinny black wire) was what was clipped to the belayers harness. The leader was taking repeated whippers, about 50 feet up. When I noticed this,  all I could muster was “stop what you’re doing,” before I had the leader clip directly to a bolt and put them on belay myself. I guess those loops are pretty tough!

Another Gunks High E story: Party of three, leader and second were on the P2 belay (the big ledge) while the third was at P1, attached to the anchor but not the rope. They only had one rope and were trying to throw the end to him. We left as quickly as we could so as to not view whatever ensued on the overhanging P3.

Kinda funny seeing a couple mentions of RRG, makes me wanna make a thread specifically about stuff like this (or maybe just general crag stories) from the Red. I'll share a couple stories though.Was in PMRP watching a girl belay her boyfriend (probably) on an overhung sport route. He completed it without major issue, clipped mussies, lowered down, and started cleaning the draws, tramming in as he went. When he reached the first draw, instead of unclipping his tram draw, he just said "OK, you're gonna swing now" and unclipped the first draw. He swung out and pulled his belayer about 20 feet away from the wall. Luckily, it was a flat, sandy landing, but on a different route, she could've been badly hurt. I told him what he should have done and he took it pretty well. What is still shocking to me, however, is how he acted like pulling your belayer halfway across the crag is such a normal and unavoidable thing. He seemed very confident in his cleaning technique until I said something. Makes me wonder how many times he had done something like that.Another time, at Military Wall, there was a guy climbing one of the those shitty 5.9s by the main overhang. He made it to the third bolt or so, and then was way off route, literally in the moss. He was miraculously able to downclimb back to the 3rd bolt and bailed off. I, as well as my other party members, noticed that the carabiner he left looked a little strange. After climbing another route, we talked to a party that had just finished the aforementioned 5.9, and they showed us the carabiner he left. It was a hammock carabiner.

Watched a guy attempting a “gear only ascent” on bearded cabbage in Jtree without clipping the bolt off the traverse before you get into the crack. Placed some less than bomber pro then shakily tried to pull into the jams. Fell and ripped his piece only to be caught in a large bush next to a boulder 30ft feet below, I was shocked he walked away unharmed. Learned an important lesson that day, unless you’re out soloing, do yourself a favor and clip the bolt.

This one isn't even close to as bad as some of the others on here.  Just a tiny bit sketchy, not "someone was seconds from death."  It happened at a mostly sport crag at the Meadow River Gorge in West Virginia When I looked over I saw that a pair had stick clipped the first bolt of a route, but the belayer was clipped in between the climber and the stick clipped bolt.  I pointed it out to my partner and she suggested we watch for a minute and see if it was just a brain fart that they would fix before they started climbing. When they were about to start I walked over and suggested the belayer flip to the other side of the bolt.They were very nice, as I recall they then asked me to check the rest of their setup too, which was all fine.  We kept an eye on them for a little bit.  Definitely got the impression they were brand new climbers but didn't notice anything else unusual.

Ive seen a few, but recently I saw a guy in an undisclosed location in New York with renowned trad climbing who claimed to be a guide. He was rapping a multi pitch with no friction hitch or back up knots on the end of his rope. I asked him if he climbed at this undisclosed location much and he said “not really, I mostly like to do alpine and big wall climbing.” I wanted to tell him that he probably wasn’t a very good guide given the mentioned things and a few other sketch ball things he did, but I figured its best not to challenge a guide. He was pretty old so maybe he had accepted his life and place in the cosmos and decided that back ups were not necessary. However, the sketchiest part was, he was “guiding” someone who looked a little gripped. Im convinced this undisclosed location in New York with great trad climbing is like the Bermuda Triangle of sketchy climbing activities on the East Coast. The amount of gumbiness, relationship quarrels, and just overall bonkers antics I see every time Im there is unreal. Ive seen crag cats, couples gettinng engaged, couples fighting, panic attacks, didgeridoo music, babies born, babies being made, and the occasional ufo sighting over High E. No other place like it.

The amount of gumbiness, relationship quarrels, and just overall bonkers antics I see every time Im there is unreal. Ive seen crag cats, couples gettinng engaged, couples fighting, panic attacks, didgeridoo music, babies born, babies being made, and the occasional ufo sighting over High E. No other place like it. One man’s “sketchy” is another man’s SOP.

The route Great Escape at Shagg crag tends to be a gym noob magnet, as the only steep easy route at the most popular sport crag in Maine. However, what makes it sketchy is thatThe whole ~80' long route traverses along a jug rail at a 45 degree angleThe base is full of sedan-sized bouldersBecause it's popular with newer groups, someone occasionally wants to TR it and doesn't think about the pendulum risk (you could probably crater from halfway up the route)Every time I've climbed there, the crowd has shut down a TR attempt pretty much immediately, but the boulders at the base of the route still (as of a year or two ago) had blood stains from someone who took the big TR swing and suffered the consequences.

Wife and I finished YMC at Ragged Mountain in Connecticut and walked-off.  Noticed the top rope anchor for Broadway was a medium stopper (incorrect orientation to direction of load) and a girth hitched flake on fractured basalt (all non-equalized).  Mentioned our safety concern to the group of five TRing below (two large men in charge and a group of teenagers) with the response "mind your %*$#ing business a$$hole".  Well, it was towards the end of the day and we had an hour plus drive north to home.

I was at Smith one day and there was a group discussing watching someone rappel without knots, though the ends were on the ground.  They were describing the moral quandary of whether they should go over and tie knots in the end, to make sure they were safe. I stated, “if you can reach the rope from the ground to tie knots, the knots are unnecessary for safety,” or something similar. The response was, “well, we’ve seen some things.”  I chose not to engage beyond that but it seemed nuts to consider “helping” someone in that way.

Was in boulder canyon in the early 70's and saw two guys roll up in a vw van with a ladder on top, stop and unload the ladder and put it up at the base of a climb that I can't remember, climb the ladder with a rack of pins, have the ladder slip and the guy falls a few feet, they load up the ladder and off they go.

Wouldn't do it on new rappels, unless my partner is going first and knew the rope length was adequate.Most of my climbing is at the local crag and have done the routes dozens or hundreds of times.

Looking Glass: saw a guy deck after a 50’ solo slab fall. He was soloing up ~5.6 terrain with gear and 2 ropes in his pack to start from a higher ledge with a slightly harder 5.7 start. After watching the classic run backwards down the slab he fell right on his back, but luckily the ropes took the impact and he seemed fine. We tried to talk him into just chillin for a bit to make sure all was good. He insisted to keep climbing right away. The lady friend he was with looked freaked out as it was clear she wanted to stop climbing for the day. GTNP: coming off of Owen and waiting for our turn to rap the Koven, we spotted 2 climbers down soloing East Prong. First guy solo’s down on some mixed hard snow/rock terrain. No pons or axe. Made it look kinda chill. Second guy gets freaked out about the solo, the hard snow and the exposure. He got really pissed at his partner, who had the rope in his pack. Dude was not having it as the expletives were echoing off the walls and valleys. After what seemed like an hour (prob 15 mins), we couldn’t watch as this guy looked like he was going for a ride. Our turn to rap and we were gone. We had just rapped that section off of East Prong with pons a few hours prior and we were glad we did. JTNP: not sketchy but more entertaining is the classic lead Toe Jam to the Bearded Cabbage anchor bolts. I must have seen this a half dozen times. Always a weird silence in HVCG when follower is faced with the pendulum fall at the top.

I watched someone crater in The Box at Maple once on Loser. Gri-Gri misuse. Leader fell at crux and belayer girlfriend, nearest anyone can recollect, was squeezing the Gri-Gri in “feed mode” and just kept squeezing while he fell. She ended up with rope burn on her brake hand and he miraculously landed kind of flat on his back in the only patch of flat ground in a riverbed of cobbles. Dude ended up walking out and both of them reportedly endured a very long drive back to Vegas and were no worse for wear. 35 years of climbing, and thankfully, the one and only time I watched someone crater.

@LL2 that's my worry with the Grigri, though if she were holding the brake strand it is my understanding the Grigri would lock?I have never quite felt comfortable with holding down the cam for this reason. Human panic response is to clamp down on the cam harder, preventing exactly what needs to happen to arrest the falling climber.It's what I feel Mammut got right with the Smart. You defeat the assisted braking by pulling up and out on the device, but if the climber falls while paying out slack, panic response would be to clamp down and bring the hands closer to the body,  instantly locking the device off.

Julian, she was squeezing the cam and holding the brake end, but due to the squeezing the brake end of the rope just burned through through her hand. Maybe more modern Gri-Gris addressed this better, but with the original design it was a problem. The release lever was never engaged. I think it was totally a function of clamping harder on the cam, to where the brake hand couldn’t possibly grip tight enough to stop the fall. Thus the burn.

Hard Is Easy did test this user error — although he was specifically testing whether the Grigri would lock if the brake strand was not held at all (spoiler alert, it did not).

The climber fell and the belayer panicked and just stared at the climber falling. The fall was about 15-20 feet and he landed on the belayer so it was just two bruised egos.

I had a nineteen year old guy who had been climbing for just over a year free solo above me when I was halfway up a 10d. He was doing a 5.9 variation that veers into a chimney rather than pulling a mini roof. He was visibly shaking, sweating, his eyes wide as saucers. I was so pissed and wanted to curse him out for putting me and every one at the crag in danger, but kept quiet to not freak him out any more than he was.Later ran into the same dude at Mungingella. He ran out the entire route on like a single rack of a #2 and below (he was oozing over his brand new shiny ultralight mastercams). Maybe stopped once? I was happy to see him roped up.I didn't see this personally, but heard it. I was at a super popular local crag, the Trinity Aretes, and heard a bloodcurdling scream. A climber had leaned back to lower after cleaning the anchor to Gold Rush iirc, and the belayer was hands-free on a tube ATC. Climber fell like 60-70 feet and the fall was only arrested because someone was standing on the rope lying on the ground.

Some sport rappellers threw a 100m static line down the most popular multipitch in the Blue Mountains and rappelled down over the top of a couple of parties, knocking debris on everyone the whole time.A well know local climber exchanged words in person and then shamed them on Facebook, the post exploded, the rappellers found the post and they continued arguing. Tensions are high because someone died on the route last year due to rockfall.This sport rappeller says that he yelled "rope" so it's all OK!PSA, don't climb Sweet Dreams on the weekend.

February day in the Adirondacks, three people are heading up an icy slide and another party (including me) are at the bottom. 80' up the route, a microwave-sized bulge of solid blue water ice looks like it has some air behind it. The leader arrives at the microwave block. Without looking down or saying anything, he starts using his axe shaft to lever it out and trundles it down towards his two followers, who are directly in the fall line. One reaches out his arms to (pretend?) to catch the flying block and they laugh as it shoots past them and laugh again when it smashes into a trunk and shakes the ground. It was a guaranteed fatality if taken to the chest or head.

Saw this today at Index in WA: Guy is lead rope soloing saggitarious, looking worked and hanging on a piece. Down solos, cleans and comes over to first pitch of Japanese Gardens, which my partner and I are just finishing (to the first chains only). We offer to give him a regular lead belay because it would just be just better? But he wants to rope solo it. He works up to a thin section about 20’ up, places a couple of pieces while we are telling him gear beta, z-clips, then realizes his gri-gri is loaded backwards! Goes in direct to the crux .2 cam and fixes the gri. For some reason, he removes his last piece, so now he only has that .2 between him and the ground. He moves up, places another .2, pumps out and falls. He pulls the first .2 and falls 30’, the other .2 catches and he stops 6” from the ledge! No helmet. We climbed it again to retrieve his gear and the .2 axle was real bent. Lucky guy. My takeaways: 1: The modern gear we have is amazing. This guy was 210lbs, took a 30’ fall on 55’ of rope and that .2 locked in. 2: it’s more fun and safer to climb with other people who will belay you. Another climber at the crag traded numbers with this guy and offered belays so he didn’t have to rope solo. Hopefully he survives his trad climbing journey. Be safe out there, friends!

Not nearly as wild as lots here but once I was a pitch up the liberty bell and up comes a guy with a go pro to the belay ledge. He slings a tiny tree and tries to clove into his new non redundant anchor. After a few tries he just can't figure out the clove and just clips himself in with a non locker. When his partner arrives he proceeds to complain about how slow she was and how she doesn't know what she's doing. Bad vibes for sure.

One time I was following a moderate pitch with one microtrax on El Cap, about 2000ft up. Partner had led it and fixed the rope. Half way up this 5.10 pitch the rope was feeding funny through the traxion, so I checked and realized that I had loaded the device wrong - I had clipped it to my locker with the pulley side in; not deadly this way but really annoying with the rope. Luckily I had good foot holds, but it was too steep to go hands-free. So I rested the back of my head against a flake so I could free both my hands to rethread the device. It probably wasn't the smartest thing I did that day.

A dad with his kid, his friend, and his friend's kid leads a blocky 5.7 at the local crag and sets up a TR with a brand new rope and what were essentially Walmart carabiners. He somehow reaches the ground safely. His son however fell a significant portion of the route aftter the anchor inevitably broke while he was being lowered back to the ground. The kid was very injured and taken out of the canyon by search and rescue. Last I heard he made a full recovery but it could have easily been a fatal mistake.I also witnessed a VERY large section of a wall at Volunteer Canyon break apart while climbing a multipitch on the opposite side of the canyon. Needless to say, we booked it up the last couple pitches and got out of there.

A few weeks ago I was near Boulder with a spare afternoon, so figured I should check out the Flatirons.  I picked Freeway since it seemed to be the local easy classic. I arrived at the base and saw a party of three soloists on the route, about 20 meters up. The lowest of them was on a small ledge, maybe 1 foot wide.  He seemed a little uncertain of how to proceed and his friends were giving him beta.  After much deliberation, he starts climbing.  A meter off the ledge, he starts panicking and desperately stabbing for feet. He falls, but lands on this ledge, so no harm done.So what do his "friends" do?  They persuade him to try again. He falls again.Eventually one friend downclimbs and shows him a much easier variation a couple meters left.They seem to have lived.

It's a skill taught in the AMGA Single Pitch Instructor curriculum. Ive also heard it being effectively used when a recreational party was climbing in Eldo and the belayer had a heart-attack mid-pitch. (everyone was ok)

Ive seen a few, but recently I saw a guy in an undisclosed location in New York with renowned trad climbing who claimed to be a guide. He was rapping a multi pitch with no friction hitch or back up knots on the end of his rope. I asked him if he climbed at this undisclosed location much and he said “not really, I mostly like to do alpine and big wall climbing.” I wanted to tell him that he probably wasn’t a very good guide given the mentioned things and a few other sketch ball things he did, but I figured its best not to challenge a guide. He was pretty old so maybe he had accepted his life and place in the cosmos and decided that back ups were not necessary. However, the sketchiest part was, he was “guiding” someone who looked a little gripped. Im convinced this undisclosed location in New York with great trad climbing is like the Bermuda Triangle of sketchy climbing activities on the East Coast. The amount of gumbiness, relationship quarrels, and just overall bonkers antics I see every time Im there is unreal.

I haven’t seen a ton of super sketchy things at this unnamed new york trad destination, but there have been a few. A little while ago, some kids (like 7 or 8 years old) are top roping apoplexy, and a guy walks up, puts climbing shoes on, and proceeds to shakily free solo apoplexy, passing this kid on the way, without saying a word to anyone.

At the gallery in the red a few years back I saw a group of people trying to make it up a fairly popular climb. The leader couldn’t finish so another member of the group took over. I look back a min later and all the quick draws except the one on the last bolt had been removed. The new leader cleaned them all on their way up and was now leading past trying to get to the chains but kept falling on the sole quick draw.   Before I could chime in another group pointed it out and convinced them to lower.

I was in American Fork Canyon.  A group of two next to me showed up to climb.  The guy climbing touted his experience and that he could solo this 5.9.  He had a new person who had never belayed.  The guy was a mess, he kept dropping his hand.  I said is it okay if I back you up? The belayer was like sure I don't know what I am doing.  The climber reminds me he can solo this.So I back him up,  the grigri is loaded backwards (first mistake).  The guy belaying was flustered. Awesome solo guy proceeds to take a huge whipper.  Luckily I had him on belay so he didn't die.Geez People

I participated in a climbing comp this past weekend at a local crag. There was a couple climbing near us who we’d met the previous evening. I looked over in horror as I noticed the woman was belaying using a gri gri with one hand on the climber side of the rope and one hand holding back the gri gri lever. I calmly and promptly corrected her. I was happy to see them both alive at the end of the day.

Let's say a team of Alex and Tommy kinda caliber climbers were to go up as many El cap routes as they could in 24 hours, including every route so east butt is in. How much aid would make sense vs. free assuming very competent aid and free climbers? Would routes be biased towards the right side because it would be faster to get down?

Honnold and Leary did 3 in a day (24 hours, not calendar day) in 2010. Nose, Salathe, Lurking Fear. http://elcapreport.com/content/elcap-report-63010Certainly an elite level team, but it seems like they just went and did it without extensive rehearsal laps (aside from existing familiarity with the routes).  With extensive rehearsal, would it be possible to speed things up to fit in a 4th? Probably, especially if you count the East Buttress. Sounds painful.

I’d bet that any team that could do 3 El Cap routes in a day could also include the East Butt.The easiest 5 in a day would be the West Face, Lurking Fear, Salathe, Nose and East Butt.Actually, trading out the Salathe for the Triple Direct would be the easiest but I don’t know if that would be acceptable.

there's a video out there of someone rapping el cap on one very long rope, takes about 15 minutes? that would avoid base jumping and also eliminate the day of logistics. could have a crew set that up and just take the elevator down. that might be faster than base jumping even if you have people set that up for you since with a jump you'd land far away from the base of the route and even running to the base would take longer than a 15 minute rap i would think. i'd say that's the ticket. someone do it!

Assuming that you are trying to maximize total # of pitches of climbs, my guess is that doing a bunch of the salathe variations  in a row, ( mostly free,  with french free at the cruxes), combined with the single-rope rappel setup that ilya referred to, would be the most efficient approach. If goal is just pitch maximization-- my guess is that a world class climber could do the nose ~6 times in a day using this approach (4hr nose laps, 15min single-rope descent, ~180 total pitches).matt

It's a fun thought exercise, but in reality multiple El Cap routes in a day does get done. So IMO it's more interesting to think about realistically what are the next steps in the progression. It wouldn't be BASE jumps (illegal). It wouldn't be a single rap line (cavers bring a single line to rap every once in a while but it's a big effort with a lot of people, they're not going to just keep it open so a climber can use it when they're ready). So Mark's approach is more interesting to me because it's what climbers could actually end up doing. I wouldn't include the East Buttress because most people don't think of it as a full El Cap route (West Face is debatable but I'd include it). Yes arbitrary I know.So 4 may be: Climb the West Face, rap Lurking Fear, climb it, rap it, climb the Triple Direct, descend East Ledges. Climb the Nose, descend East Ledges.

It's surprising that this hasn't been guessed yet. I thought maybe it was too easy! Then again, people often skip the 1st few pitches of this route, including this one. Maybe these days  everyone just traverses in at the halfway mark to climb the great pitches?I've done it both ways, but IMHO every climber should do this entire route at least once in their lives.FA's are legends. FA: Warren Harding & Glen Denny;  FFA Ron Kauk & John Yablonski.Maybe those are enough hints?

This one is going to be tricky since I think very very few parties have actually done this route. However I have faith that this crew can deduce the formation/route with a bit of guess work and effort. Only hint I'll initially provide is that the approach is ~2 hours give or take 30 min.Edit: Sheep Thrills is too far south still but Abandon got the area! Edit: Not Conness but ya'll are getting closer!

Being that many of the routes being posted are often of ‘local renown’, it would be great if even the ones that are successfully identified are put into ‘context’ for the rest of us—not only their name, but location ( climbing area and formation) as well. It shouldn’t be only those that aren’t identified ( such as the above route) that have such information provided. So many of these routes look wonderful, but often, even after they are named, I am clueless as to where they are located and I believe that many others are in a similar situation. Thanks.

Some people already do this, but not everyone.I agree with the overall suggestion though, lots of these routes end up on my 'todo' list.

A bit of thread drift here, but what is the current status of climbing in the Superstitions? I climbed in Zonerland a couple of times years ago and thought that it was a great place, but subsequently heard that climbing there had been  shut down—or maybe it was just no new bolting. Presuming this is a recent picture, at least some climbing is happening in the range.

Not sure about currently as I no longer live there. Picture is from a few years back and I remember it was no new bolts, but climbing existing stuff was just fine.

It wasn't until your hints that I realized it was correct. 3 really good pitches & 2 crappy ones, up stellar positioning, leading to a fantastic viewpoint. Thanks for the memories!Alan Rubin

Well I seem to have ruined the game a bit with an obscurity. That photo is roughly the view from Las Vegas, NM on I25, which anyone who's driven from Denver to Hueco or a major NM city has passed. That's El Porvenir Canyon, which has tons of tall granite faces but relatively few recorded routes for the volume of rock.Here's one that more people should know but that's also not exactly crowded with suitors.

I just assumed it was too remote for the ABQ crowd who'd rather climb in the Sandias for similar rock and way less driving.I seem to be 0/2 on finding the right middle ground between obvious and obscure, so to keep it moving, name that route:The previous route was Dark Angel at the Underworld on the Gold Coast of Linville Gorge, one of the most beautiful walls i've seen.

Loved that route, almost lost a finger from rockfall the first time I tried it,… fun hike out with a mangled finger. For this one, technically 4 routes converge at the chains she’s clipping, but only 2 will count for the right answer.

Couch Time is at Willow River state park in WI. It's closed to climbing on Saturdays year-round and is only open 6am-Noon in the summer (normal hours in the off-season). It's up near the MN border so the access restrictions mean that while everyone I climbed with in Chicago wanted to check it out, the long drive meant we always ended up in So Ill or the RRG instead.

One cool side effect of working on the SPS list (I'm about 135/250 complete) is that you walk right past unclimbed walls from time to time!

Yep, you got it. Haha every time I drive through town I try to figure out which of the 10 identical-looking bulges on the ridgeline is which route. From a distance they all look the same. In person this one's like 1/3 as big as Price for Fire. Edit: Per Alan's request, the arete I posted is the top of a short, very bouldery 5.13 that goes up the overhang below. It's also used by a safe but committing 5.8ish route that traverses out from the dihedral to the left, using smeared feet right on the lip of the roof. This is at Morrison (home of Red Rocks Amphitheater), better known for its contrived bouldering cave.

Not to hijack this thread like I normally do - but it makes me really nervous when I see the little ones running around the base of a crag without a helmet. The unthinkable happened and a toddler was hit in the head with rockfall at lowertown wall without a helmet - last I heard was that the child was in critical condition but survived. Could have easily been a tragedy. Just some stuff to think about - carry on

That IS a tragedy!    Todds should be no where near the bottom anything remotely chossy, a body shot could kill them. Leash them up at least 30ft back if you must bring them at all.

My not-so-little-anymore monkey.  Seven turned eight this year.. got lots of pitches in; getting really good at cleaning trad gear and climbing trad pitches; lead his first sport climb (with me behind him on a tail); got his first clean 5.11 on TR at Smith; got to climb sea cliffs in Acadia; found his first comp podium; and really seemed to find his focus and try hard this year when he wants to.  A good year for this climber.

The pictures in this thread of the kids climbing are cute.  But the normalization of toddlers being brought to crags is awful. It isn't a safe environment for them and nobody wants to deal with your crying baby that can't properly express themselves yet. Becoming a parent. especially of ones who can't walk or talk, requires major lifestyle changes.  Forcing others to deal with an infant when they're trying to have adult fun is not cool. My friend group constantly talks about how annoying it is these famous climbers posting their pack n plays at the base of rock climbs after giving birth.

It our job as a civilization to "deal with" other people's crying babies, that way when they run into a 34 year old man child they have the emotional skillset necessary to tell them to sh** in someone else's wheaties.

I'm also quite comfortable having my own opinion, ignoring your viewpoint, and doing as I please.TLDR? Your opinion on raising kids is only that. Your opinion.For the record?I MET Ryan Climbs and his family, and their friends and family. All 4 parents did an oustanding job with their families, in some of the most sucked weather conditions I've ever encountered at City of Rocks. Truly heroic!Fwiw?I had my infant son on a rooftop with me, and all kinds of other places, when he was little. I was self employed, and he got to be with me almost 24/7. He survived and turned out pretty good.I'm 66, and everyone my age was pretty much ENTIRELY feral as a kid. The world isn't safe, and never will be.But so what????For almost all of human history, kids have been side by side with parents, siblings, family, extended family, that proverbial village.....@Ryan, wow, a brief bit of sunshine and blue sky!

Pretty sure my toddler can properly express herself. She'd hear this and straight up ask you "What the F*ck?" Normalize parents needing their mental health breaks or you can help find a solution to childcare cause I'm not sure who can afford $20-$25/hr to get a day of climbing in all the time. Maybe try not going to such popular crags and getting farther away. Speakers are more annoying and ill behaved dogs in my opinion. Also, exposure for them will hopefully inspire a love when they're older. Maybe your jealous your parents weren't that cool as I'm certain some of these kids are going to be crushers.

My twelve year old on some 5.fun routes.I really nursed this since the day he was born. Always offering but never pushing. Some days we'd go out to climb but end up just watching an anthill and having snacks. Whatever he was psyched for that day. Now he's slowly becoming my favorite climbing partner.---First time above the clouds.He really had to dig deep for this one, to deal with the physical exertion and the exposure. We spent the night on the false summit and scrambled down the next day. Back at the trail head he said he felt like a better person from it, like he'd grown, he said. My heart soared.

The easiest way to do it is to use two pairs of slip joint pliers to apply opposing forces to the thread on the Superclip device, which 'opens' it up a little, and then get a second person to unscrew the pole.

Thanks for all the tips everybody. I wound up getting it off as per John Byrnes by cutting away the shrink wrap, grabbing the bottom “thread” of the superclip with a small pair of vise grips and the shaft of the pole with a pair of channel locks. Probably could have done it with just the visegrips had I not cranked the thing on their trying to unscrew from the top  Now I’m wondering about how important that shrink wrap is, anybody have thoughts?Was thinking about giving a tight wrap with some electrical tape or something but wondering if it actually does anything or just cosmetic.

Does it work?  Does it help?  I keep seeing climbers pick up these endorsements and even TC says he’s using it so I figured it might be worth looking into, but the research is still pretty inconclusive.  I’m getting up there (37) and definitely have my fair share of climbing related aches and pains, so the promise of faster/better recovery is definitely tempting.  Has anyone tried it and noticed an appreciable difference?

First, I'm not a doctor ... well, maybe a WebMD doctor buuuuuut I've used both topical (balm/lotion) and oral.  Topical seem to work pretty well for me but nothing more than something like arnica.  I've actually combined arnica, tincture CBD oil and lotion which was a great combot!  I use it mainly for inflammation in my hands/joints purposes.  Oral has been hit or miss for me.  The only noticeable difference is when I use a high dosage of tincture which isn't the cheapest.  I've heard to feel more of an effect is to use a bit of THC but "that" feeling might be associated with the body's reaction to THC ha.  Idk - seems too early to tell.

Personal experience: picked up some JTree products with CBD when my husband bid on a fundraiser silent auction “lot” of JTree items at Rocktoberfest last fall. This included JTree climbing salve with CBD, and honey with CBDVerdict: 1) the climbing salve with CBD is a bit more “runny” than JTree’s normal climbing salve. And smells different. Didn’t notice any other effect of using it.2) Honey with CBD tastes bitter. And seems to have no effect on anything, whatsoeverAs the packaging says, “CBD MAY have a myriad of benefits.” My emphasis on MAY.

I think it worth trying it at least once. There will be no harm, but you will find out for yourself if it works or not. I usually apply it after a workout or any other physical activity to reduce muscle pain, and it works for me. I also heard that it has other benefits apart from pain relief. But you need to google them because everyone days different things about it. Recently I’ve even found on knockoutcbd.com cartridges with different flavors for my vape. It says that it has the same effects as CBD oil, but when I’m vaping, I just feel relaxed.

I tried it, it didn't do anything for me.  I know a lot of smart people I like who feel like it does for them... who am I to argue with their lived experiences of using their bodies. It's not like it's either super expensive by a lot of folks standards or is likely to have a negative outcome.I have a pretty long scoreboard of things I have tried, some have been unexpectedly successful for.me (fasting, meditation, not getting drunk every night) and some have not been (foam rolling, duolingo, deer whistlers, low-plate-voltage tube electronics).CBD fell far enough into that latter category that I am not inclined to keep trying it myself, but not so far that I would judge folks for using it in the way I'd judge someone for using a turn-of-the-century cassette 4-track to create analog warmth in their recordings.

Many people are reporting benefits, but doctors and scientists haven't looked at it enough to say anything conclusively, other than it helps with certain kinds of epilepsy.  (There is currently an FDA-approved CBD-based drug that significantly reduces seizures).  In addition to the lack of sufficient research, it won't be FDA-regulated until 2022.  It's currently listed as a "health supplement", meaning companies can legally lie about their products.  Some products have very different levels of CBD (more or less) than what is claimed.  Some even have unlisted THC in them.I live in Colorado, so I get flower that is grown to have high CBD and low THC.  THC helps increase the effect of CBD due to their agonist-antagonist relationship.  Also, because I'm getting weed at the weed store, it has to meet certain guidelines and must advertise proper levels of each chemical +/-20%, so I at least know what I'm getting.  I use it every once in a while.  (I vaporize it so I'm not smoking anything.)  I've found it reduces muscle soreness.  Some are touting it as a magical recovery aid, which it might be, but I'm not sure if it's actually making me less sore through some recovery mechanism, or it just makes it so I can't feel how sore I really am.  It definitely reduces my anxiety, which is another benefit that others have reported.  However, I don't use it to treat anxiety as I have personal qualms about using a drug to do something I can do without a drug.  But I do find a certain reduction in my mental chatter after using it.I've never messed with topicals, but I have a friend who fixed his elbow tendonitis with CBD.  He is a seriously good personal trainer so he understands the body, and tried a bunch of other things.  YMMV.

CBD without THC , seems ineffective for pain and inflammation for me. ( bi-lateral amputee), together they are like magic for me, sleeping through the night after a day of climbing without the combination is highly unlikely.

119223675,Aug 3, 2020,JNE,

It is hard to pin down exactly what the ultimate cause is, but in the last few months I have made a very concerted effort to reduce any inflammation in my knuckles. The changes I have made is trying to better balance my omega fats, taking a daily dose of CBD, and taking a daily calcium/magnesium/zinc (thinking joint inflammation might have something to do with a reduction in available calcium and magnesium and thus an inability for the body to repair damage).  For CBD I use a product which provides about 12.5 mg of 'full spectrum' CBD per dose, and I take one dose a day.  I can now get my knuckles into finger locks which I have not been able to use for years, so something I am doing appears to be working. Is it the cal/mag/zinc supplement? The CBD? Balancing the Omega fats? A combination? None of the above? It is hard to say. One thing I can say though is I have been taking the cal/mag/zinc for nearly a year and I have been balancing my omega fats to some degree for a decade or more (though not as well as I am now), but I have only been taking the CBD for the last few months, and it is in the last few months that I have seen the change in my knuckles.  My thinking is that CBD has to do with regulating the immune system (here and here), and some of the inflammation we experience is due to some degree of an overactive immune system in that the inflammation is caused by the immune system attacking otherwise healthy cells, and that CBD helps address this specific type of inflammation. To re-iterate what others have said, I don't find the results to be earth shattering in their dramatic result. Instead I would say it is like taking ibuprofen to help heal something: it helps but is not anything close to a cure.

I use topical cbd on my shoulder after a day of wall climbing if I'm going to continue climbing on that wall the next day. Normally I wake up with massive pain in my shoulder that takes about 30 minutes to slowly pass. If I use the topical the night before (ibuprofen does nothing for this for me), this has effectively stopped happening in the morning. No clue if it's placebo effect or actually working.

Okay it's a necropost, but still a relevant topic. I took low dose oral cbd daily for several months. I climbed the best in my life and needed much less recovery time, though I believe all that climbing (4-5 days per week instead of my usual 3) put me at risk of injury. I stopped taking it because it made me fuzzy in the head, which is not okay with my job. I recently tried topical and found I can't do that either without getting fuzzy. I was using the same brand though. Might try a different brand at some point because I really did see performance & recovery benefits.

I will tell you the same thing I say to anyone else that asks about wonder drugs.  If it works for you, it works for you.  Even if the only reason it works is the placebo effect, it still works.As for the science of CBD, there isn't enough research to point conclusively that it does any of the things that proponents claim.  Everything is just anecdotal evidence.  There is research that CBD has certain medicinal properties, but where the rubber meets the road is dosing and delivery.  Water is essential to life, but if you drink too much or try to breathe it, you will die.  Most of the research I have seen on CBD is that for it to have the medicinal properties that are claimed, you need to take in way more than what most people who claim the benefits are taking.

As a anti-inflammatory for sore joints, soft tissue, etc I feel that its performance is marginal at best.  Compared to other natural anti-inflammatories like Tumeric or omega 3 oils, definitely not worth the price.  For neurological disorders-  seizures, neurogenic pain, and insomnia - it seems to perform much better for folks and might be worth looking into.

I am not a doctor, but I can tell you that you can use CBD for medical purposes. A lot of doctors recommend their patients CBD oil to help them deal with depression, anxiety, or sleep problems. So if you have some of these problems, you can use some CBD products. But before purchasing anything, discuss this with your doctor. For instance, when I first used CBD, I spoke with a friend who works for the Toronto Dispensary near me to understand the effects CBD has on our bodies. It just made me feel better.

Given there are like 10 different things that actually work which you probably aren't doing, CBD is not the thing I'd try.The only thing there's strong evidence for with CBD is treatment of some seizure disorders. There are studies showing it works for a few other things, probably most notably anxiety, but these haven't been reproduced to my knowledge, and the effect sizes are small enough that it's probably not notable even if it is true.

"CBD," short for cannabidiol, is a compound derived from the cannabis plant. It has gained popularity for its potential therapeutic benefits, such as reducing anxiety, pain, and inflammation. Unlike THC, another cannabis compound, CBD doesn't produce a "high" effect.Research on CBD is ongoing, and while some studies suggest its effectiveness in treating certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy and chronic pain, more research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects and benefits. CBD products are available in various forms, including oils, capsules, and creams, but it's crucial to buy from reputable sources, as quality can vary significantly. Always consult a healthcare professional before using CBD for any specific health concerns.

I hereby challenge you!  Bottom to top, no bolts, no retreat.  The only way off is up. Thirty miles of 700ft vertical Navajo Sandstone awaits. I beckon you who like the daring objective. Boltless, tall, committing and esthetic. No fixed gear is allowed in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area but pitons and removable bolts could be used if necessary. I am an aging domesticated father, well past the bold stage, who still loves everything about this sport.  I have spent most of my climbing life toiling in this sand and choss, far away from the hordes I read about on this site. I have thoroughly enjoyed the solitude, but find myself longing for other like-minded nutjobs. I throw out this challenge not braggadociously but in hopes that you will provide me entertainment. I can’t think of anything I would rather do than sit on the edge of the Colorado River and watch badasses do what badasses do. So, as a teaser, I offer up the Honey Draw Dihedral as a route that Matt Penrod and I put up in this style.  I fell a few times on the crux pitch so the route still awaits an FFA.  I would be happy to show it to you, all I ask is that you coordinate with me so that I can be a spectator and take photos.  And before you say it….I don’t worry about Glen Canyon ever becoming a destination for the hordes.  The rock quality, the approach, the commitment and that fact that the cool people don’t think it’s cool will keep the place quiet.  If I’m wrong, there are twenty seven other venues I can go to climb alone in this amazing region.

"sweet" area, is very relative, but for the right type of nut job it is an amazing place with endless objectives if you include Marble/Grand Canyons. The problem with carrying a pack raft down the Ropes Trail (I believe that's the Cable Route you are referring to) is that you would have to haul the raft out with you up the climb.  You can't repel back to your raft on the river without leaving gear.

Libations and a campfire are had in the sideyard. 2.  A river skiff - Perfect for skiffing 2 nut jobs and their gear up the Colorado River from Lee's Ferry to Glen Canyon Dam. But wait, there's more!!  The skiff comes fully furnished with a Coast Guard Certified Captain (yours truly) with over 30 years of river experience.  Disclaimer: The captain may be a bit cantankerous, prone to profanity and smell of burnt rope.  Skiff and guide are subject to availability and may not be an option if I am away. 3. If your adventure demands it, my muddy old 2002 Ford F150 4x4 will deliver you closer to the top of your objective.  See the disclaimer above. FAME 4. The Trophy - Your name will be entered into the annals of history by being scribed upon the Glen Canyon Challenge Trophy, a Boreal Calzado Deportivo shoe that once belonged to a really famous climber and still smells like it to this day.FORTUNE5. The winner of the Challenge shall receive this amazingly beautiful one-dollar bill that may or may not have been in John Long's pocket during the first one-day ascent of the Nose. BOUNTY6. Food - All Challengers, successful summiteers or not, shall receive either a jar of my famous Arizona Style Garlic Dill Pickles or a satchel of my less famous but equally tasty, peppered venison or elk jerky (jerky is subject to season availability).  TREASURE 7.  Photography/Videography - All contestants will be bestowed all the photographs and videos that I might capture of their epic, to do with what they wish. The Champeen for the year will be given (shipped free of charge) one of my signature, custom carved, sandstone frames, to put the best picture of themselves shralping the gnar for all gumbies and sportos to envy.  The frame above measures 24 x 18 inches but can be made much smaller. SPRAYOf course, no Glen Canyon Challenge would be complete without a whole shit ton of yarn spinning and shit talk from this sandy curmudgeon who's been adventuring in this broken landscape for decades.

Still no takers on the glen canyon challenge?!Nope! But let me tell you what I suspect. Most crusty Desert Trad Rats shun the spotlight with all their might.  The last thing they ever want to do is bring attention to themselves and their exploits. I would like to believe that I am one of those people, because I too, have kept some of my most precious achievements in the desert backcountry hidden from public view.    If I were to bet, I would say that there have already been multiple parties that have established routes in response to this Challenge, yet tell no one.  I admire this quality wholeheartedly and if anyone requested it, I would keep their exploits on the D.L.  I am aware of quite a few (20-30), "Routes to Nowhere" in the Glen Canyon that end before the rim and utilize repel anchors. All of these First Ascensionists (some of them deceased) have told not a soul outside of their inner circle about these routes.  I am only aware of two routes that have been established without permanent anchors and go to the top.  I do know that there are a few routes that are boltless that have walk-offs short of the summit rim though.  There are many of this type of route to be had down there if that's your bag.  As a point of discussion or thought; It is legal to bolt in the Grand Canyon, In Cataract Canyon, in Canyonlands, in Zion and Arches but not in Glen Canyon...... where they have a HUGE F*#!ing Dam built to form the 2nd largest man-made lake in the country.  Why?  Makes no sense whatsoever.  Anyway, I was just down in the canyon yesterday and took these photos for all you gapers.  This lovely little chocolatey wall is at the bottom of a mildly popular 5th-class trail, so access from the top and bottom would be very easy.  There is a designated campsite at the bottom, complete with a nice toilet that doesn't stink very badly,  in view of a petroglyph panel, so you can appreciate a bit of history while dropping the morning deuce.  I first noticed the pin scars and tat back in 1994 or so.  I would LOVE to know the story behind it.  It looks as if they didn't make it to the top, as I have glassed it thoroughly and can find no evidence of them up higher.  The feature to the left is clean and shows no signs of being climbed. Drop me a message and I'll show you where it is my Huckleberries!! Oh, and I forgot to mention;  As a bonus, there is free food in the river.

Or if I were the Holy Hanlove himself, offering to scribe your name on my TC Pro for a choss fest climbing challenge, people would be crawling out of the woodwork to take a stab at winning my stinky shoe.  But in the end, I am more than comfortable with my star status within the community and the lowly prowess of the cliffs I adore; and am happy enough just lobbing taunts at you strangers on the interwebz in lieu of my work responsibilities.

You were the one who first taught me how to trad climb. Do you remember the first time you took Matt and I out to the Overlook and I forgot my ATC? You gave me yours and started to rapel using a Munter Hitch but your rope was so old that the sheath disintegrated and started sliding down the core.  I remember being in awe as you calmly yelled down to another party and asked if you could swing over and use their line. It was the absolute perfect way to begin my journey. Thanks for being so kind to Matt and I. Your stoke was paid forward in full. Are you still in Flag?

What do you think these go at? As promised.  When scoping potential lines in GCNRA it is advisable to look at the top 50 feet of rock and then work your way down to the canyon floor.  The rim rock is usually where the horror dwells and many a' superb looking line is rendered shitty by it.  Think of it as a Chocolate Cake with turd frosting.  The Chocolatey Wall is no exception.  Remember that you can always rap in and clean first before committing to the send.

Maybe one of those mega tour buses? For a small town, Page actually has a very nice airport and an airline that offers a flight to Phoenix...... but....  the airline is notorious for canceling flights when there isn't enough seats booked.  This is especially true at the beginning of the week.  If you can absorb that kind of possible inconvenience/assholery then you can fly directly here.   There is no other public transport to Page.  There are Grand Circle tour busses and if you are into rolling with old people to all the prime roadside destinations, drinking brandy and taking pictures of Stateline Signs, then maybe it might be a hoot for you. It'll coast you a bit more though, but at least it comes with a tour guide who might or might not be able to drive a bus. St. George is a little over 2 hours from here and has a real airport and rental cars. Or you could go Hanlove/Caldwell on it and buy a mountain bike; ride it to all the cool crags near St George, picking off prime routes, then hit Zion to send some big wall routes, finishing it off by riding to Page and winning the GCC shoe trophy with a grizzly FA of a virgin route in Glen Canyon. Make a documentary about it and then you're rich. So there's that.  Or you could just hitchhike or drive or something.

Kyran, can you sleep on the walls in Glen Canyon? Can you bivy on the ground next to the walls? I guess I'm asking both from a local law enforcement/ranger perspective, and also an availability of ledges/falling rock/weather safety perspective. I'm a pretty mediocre climber, but I could maybe make it up in a couple days aid soloing the scary parts and rope soloing the easier parts. And this sounds like exactly the kind of adventure I keep telling myself I want, but suck at actually accomplishing! And I took the week of Thanksgiving off from work, so that helps too.

I was recently told by another gym user (not an employee) that down climbing will damage the auto belay (TruBlue in this case). I have been doing this for several years at this same gym with no comment from staff. I have also seen a class at this gym doing endurance runs climbing both up and down with the auto belay (with staff instructor present). On the other hand, at the newer Sharma gym near Barcelona, I was told that down climbing on auto belay (TruBlue, I think) was not permitted but I don't remember why or even if they gave a reason--not sure if it was the possibility of damaging the mechanism or if it was just a courtesy rule for those waiting. I have looked up the manuals for both TruBlu and Perfect Descent and see no mention of down climbing being allowed or not. I do, however, see plenty of Google search results that talk about the benefits of practicing down climbing in the gym and the auto belay being a good system to use for this training. A brief search on MP´s forums didn't help... or maybe I missed something?Any auto belay experts out there want to clear this up? (Yeah, I know... first world problems and all... and when there is so much REAL rock to down climb.)

The woman who told me this seemed like she knew what she was talking about and I’m always wary of any “black holes” I might have in my climbing knowledge and willing to keep an open mind and learn… (even though I’m by no means a newbie to this rodeo).

Complaint poem from my LA days... been a long time since I've been a gym at this point Ode to Gym Rat Flunkies.Oh you gym rat flunkies-you flunkies I abhor.You say you want to leave your gym.It's padded walls are closing in.To climb on nature's rock one daywould be so cool- oh Maid please say,you'll take us out oh please oh pleaseand cure us of this gym disease.Your excitement seems sincereuntil it's time to buy some gear.Or to commit to time or placeto feel the sun upon your face.And then the ones who make the callThey show up late, or not at all.Then the whining does ensueDrive where?? Too hot, too dusty too.Egads! The rock- it is so far.They cannot even see their car.To walk 10 minutes from the streetmakes blisters on their widdle feet.Yes there's a problem, one or two,my teachings just can't make it through.To penetrate these flunkie heads,frustrates me to the point of dread.I've totally abandoned hopethat you'll stop stepping on my rope.That line above ... the bee's knees!Lead? Not before all hell doth freeze!Where's the tape? which way to go?Your shiny webbing, is day-glow.Begging, pleading and my rancorwon't pry you off that three-bolt anchorPlease oh please, our dark-haired mavenreturn us to our plastic haven.Back to the loving, cool indoorsWith colored holds and squishy floors.Where gym rats go to romp and playOutside?? Perhaps another day.Edit to add: 1/2 credit to Dirtineye ( RIP) for that ^^^ .

Crags of trap rock, secret mountains of chossBarren cliff tops, vegetation is deadHolds break, loose rock falls on your partner's headLand use disputes, access a constant lossAnother hold breaks loose, give it a tossCracks and chimneys begging to be ledRun out face climbs generate thrill and dreadPointless bolt wars making all of us crossGrumpy old men constantly beratingCouldn't manage to crush my happiness Climbing is pointless, but it's also funEven when my failure is frustratingI enjoy climbing not any bit lessSo I'll climb this choss till my life is done

They’re few boulders on the hillSo we walk through tired grass It's soft on shoeless feet Though its prime is fully pastIts lackluster complexion seems pre-colorcastAn  everlasting absence of much-needed chloroplastMy time here is well spent for these boulders will not lastThey may become new victims of some uncondoned blast So I savor my short time like each meal that I eatThe presents of these rocks in itself is a treatThe trees are in my ears and eyes not unlike penny laneThere's dark clouds edging bright blue sky a minor risk of rainI study hulking rocks above they shimmer like to glassLike the sharp broken shards on the road in a crash.Speckled with granite and small grains of sandSmall stains of chalk from a small fingered handThe suns is in the sky and there’s birds in each earBut they’re quite far awayThere are no trees hereThe squirrels are all chirping But in muffled cries Progress moves on,Counterclockwise.And even though the sun still rises every single day Our feud lives on from dusk till dawna slow steadfast decay.A fight fought not to win but to postpone inexorable lossSo we savor our short time and sit apon the mossThe sky then starts to darken and much to our dismay our time window is closing our bare feet must touch clayAnd so we walk solemnly across the tired grass Down the mellow slope we love for we must leave at last.The grass all changes colorFrom hay to dollar billPlease dont break our rocks There's few boulders on the hill.

Hey MP Community, since so many folks here have been avid supporters of The Zine, and helped us out in the past, I wanted to share where we are at right now, and how y'all can help: This year has started off a bit rocky for our print publication. Many sponsors are shying away from print ads, and our print and shipping costs are raising pretty dramatically. If this all happened five years ago, this post might be about The Climbing Zine up for sale to some major corporation. At this point though this thing is too important to me and our community to just let it go; plus our audience is growing more now than ever.  This is where our audience and community come in. I believe we have enough interest and support in what we are doing to sustain The Zine for many years to come. And, in 2022 we have more ways than ever for our audience to engage with our work. If you’re reading this and The Zine means something to you, please consider making an action that helps us make up for the declining print ads, and increased printing and shipping costs. (An expected $25,000 hit to our budget) Our goal is to get to add 1,000 new subscribers to The Zine, and grow the Patreon for our Dirtbag State Of Mind podcast to $1,000 per month. Thanks in advance for stepping up and keeping the zine alive, so we can keep telling stories in the 2020s and beyond!  This link will get you 15% off a subscription, and anything in our online store: https://shop.climbingzine.com/discount/KEEPTHEZINEALIVEJoin our Patreon here, starting at $3: https://www.patreon.com/theclimbingzineSincerely, Luke

Bump for Luke and this request! Stumbled on the Zine from a friend in 2019 and proud to endorse as a subscriber. It's the quirky, rad, indie, real climbing reader you should be proudly displaying on your coffee table, or tossing in your gym bag, or thumbing through between sprinter-van-hangboard sessions before passing on to a friend.

I hope everyone that sees this signs up. The Climbing Zine is a fantastic zine with stories that will make you laugh and cry. I met Luke in the creek this past October and he is as kind as he seems here. Support the zine and subscribe.Luke is there a good way to gift subscriptions?

Finally subscribed! I've gotten so much out of the zine over the past few years, I still owe you, Luke! I've bought a couple handfuls of individual zines at a crazy discount, and listened to every one of your podcast episodes, which includes two entire books. I really appreciate how generously you give to the climbing community and would love to see the zine continue to thrive.

Hope that helps, and if it doesn't fit you can always send it back!

I think the Zine is pretty neat, feels like a revival of sharing adventures and experiences with climbing that has been hard to come by during/since quarantine and less corporate than the stories of 5.15 sends, international comps, and beginner-tips type articles you'd get from Outside magazine or other. Definitely worth a bump here, and consider checking it out, and if you like it subscribing!I made this poster to help out, I'm going to print and post it at a few local gyms near me, feel free to use it too if you wish

We have reached 300, thanks everyone. We've had a nice bump after Climbing announced they were not doing print anymore too...which means we are the last widely distributed print rock climbing publication in the USA. Anywho, big thank to the MP community, and the 15% off KEEP THE ZINE ALIVE link is still valid: https://shop.climbingzine.com/discount/KEEPTHEZINEALIVEP.S. We have about 20 copies left of Volume 13, and then it will be 'out of print'. We republish stories in our "Climbing Zine Book" series, but once our original print run of a zine sells out, that's it!

Luke,I finally picked up a subscription and I am so glad I did. Vol. 22 was a pleasure to indulge in and it is apparent that your passion project really comes through where other outdoor journalism falls short. The pieces featured in this volume were personal and meaningful stories that stand in sharp contrast to the ad-driven content of other publications. Looking forward to what may come and encouraged to see you and your peers swimming against the stream. Thank you.

Last year around this time I wrote a short post called “Keep The Zine Alive”. We had lost a couple sponsors, print costs were soaring, and I was wondering how we would sustain The Climbing Zine through the year.The response to that post was beyond comforting. We added many new subscribers, and others picked up bundles of zines, books, and merch. You, our dear readers “kept the zine alive” last year. Later that spring that it was announced that Rock and Ice and Climbing were done with print.That left us and the Alpinist as the only major players in the United States doing print media for climbing; despite the fact that climbing itself is growing in astronomical ways. Continuing to publish The Zine in print is not just about business, it’s about keeping culture alive!Here we are again needing to “keep the zine alive”. In 2023, due to the economy, many companies are cutting or adjusting their advertising budgets, and thus The Zine and our Dirtbag State of Mind podcasts are getting hit. Again, my best option is to reach out directly to you, our dear readers, and communicate where we are at. To sustain The Climbing Zine we need to add more subscribers, and continue moving zine bundles, books, and merch.Last year we also got some insight from our friends at the Mountain Gazette, another fine print publication, and we are now able to offer recurring subscriptions, so we don’t have to bug you every year or two to renew. And, of course, our Dirtbag Treatment option still stands, the best way for a traveling climber to continue to get their subscription without interruption. (Photo by Irene Yee from Volume 20)Here are the links to help: Subscribe: https://shop.climbingzine.com/collections/subscriptions/products/one-year-subscription-2-issues Score some bundles, books, stickers, and merch: shop.climbingzine.com/ Support the Dirtbag State of Mind podast on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/theclimbingzine Goals for the year: add 2,000 new subscribers. Grow our Patreon to $1k per month.  Thank you kindly,Luke MehallPublisher, The Climbing ZineHost, Dirtbag State of Mind podcast

As we are embarking on our “keep the zine alive” campaign to add 2,000 new subscribers, many of our current subscribers under our old model have asked how you can support. We’ve got the answer: subscribe to our new system, and we will give you credit for the value of your remaining issues in the old subscription to spend on anything in our online store.When I was building the business, I was always offering good subscription deals for up to three years. Under this model, I had to send out individual emails when the subscriptions were over, which was basically a big mess.Now, we have a model where you can subscribe annually, with auto-renew. It’s easier for both you and me. Here’s the link to get on board with the new system.https://shop.climbingzine.com/After you place your order I’ll look up how much credit you have, and will notify you so that you can score some items from our store. I thank you for your support and for “keeping the zine alive and thriving” in 2023.Peace,Luke MehallPublisher, The Climbing Zine

We emailed back and forth and I mentioned it was a birthday present. Luke showed up at my campsite with the subscription I purchased, a kind birthday note to my partner and a shit eating grin!

Saturday Morning Edition aired a three-minute interview with Dieter at his cabin near Petersburg, Alaska, He was one of the first to attempt the still-unclimbed 2000m NW face of the Devils Thumb. (The late Mike Bearzi, who invented the M system for grading mixed routes, was his partner.) Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold chime in after consulting with Dieter, regarding their complete traverse of the DT massif. Alex calls Dieter the godfather of the Stikine Ice Cap. I wonder if the next ReelRock will show their documentary.

In the opening of the interview , host , Scott Simon falsely stated that I “…spent much of life trying to climb a near impossible summit “.   I summited it twice and also Tried the dangerous unclimbed NW Face.  I didn’t spend much of life on it, nor is it “a near impossible summit “. Another article on Devils Thumb I recently read in Mountain Project is also full of false and misleading information by a person who doesn’t seem to be a climber , nor does he understand the mountain.

The interview of me about Devils Thumb by Shelby Herbert was good. But the lead-in (opening of the interview) by Scott Simon,”host” is TOTAL BS !! The interview was aired on NPR Morning Edition on 9-9-23.  Mr. Simon falsely states that I have “…spent much of life trying to climb a near impossible summit “.  He hasn’t a Clue !  I climbed Devils Thumb twice in the’80s, and the mountain is certainly Not “near impossible “.  Many people are confused by the much attempted yet unclimbed and dangerous NorthWest face of the Thumb, compared with rest of the mountain, which in this age could be considered as Easy to summit . I didn’t succeed on my attempt to climb the notorious NW Face. An earlier article about the Devils Thumb printed by Mountain Project is even more incorrect BS.  The writer gives so much false information, Its ridiculous that it wasn’t edited by someone who knows what they’re talking about. It sounds like the author isn’t even a climber. That article is a garbage can full of crap and SHOULD BE DELETED.!It’s so sad that anyone can write or air any kind of BS they choose on the internet or radio . And people believe it !!  Dieter Klose,    Petersburg, Alaska

It’s an incredible bit of footage.If it’s a given that Silence is the hardest previous sport climb and that Ondra initially chose to work Silence and postponed Project Big because it was too intimidating, is there a credible case to be made for a new world’s hardest climb?Does it ultimately matter?

I refuse to believe this is the world’s hardest sport climb if he got it on his sixth attempt. I am also uninspired by routes that feature crazy long no hands rests. I felt like I was watching a video on shaking out and chalking technique.

124974056,Sep 20, 2023,Israel R,

I find it unlikely that Project Big is the hardest sport route in the world, based purely on the time it took Jakob to finish it. While Jakob is crazy strong, he does not have a lot of long-term projecting experience on the cutting edge and Big only took him 2 trips IIRC (granted he and Adam shared a lot of beta). Compare this to Adam's journey on Silence and his deep experience on long-term projects. I wouldn't be surprised if it got the grade of 9b+ or even 9c but from my arm chair I'd still be surprised if Adam/Seb/Stefano/Jakob called it harder than Silence. Idle speculation can be fun but comparing routes, especially ones with funky beta like Silence, is incredibly subjective and us mere mortals can only dream of having an opinion worth a damn about these routes :)Edit to clarify:Jason Kim

At the end of the video, he said he had been projecting it for 2 months. It wasn't his 6th try, but his 6th live stream attempt. I too wonder if it's actually harder than Silence.

Ah that makes a lot more sense, it was surprising to me that it went after only six tries. These sorta ambiguous cave routes just don’t do it for me, I’m always drawn to those hard climbs that follow an aesthetic, natural line. Not that I can even wrap my head around the difference between a hard 14+ crack and a 15+ in Flatanger.

I watched all of the live stream attempts as they were posted.

I liked the 'this could be it/he might never do it' dichotomy of the streaming. I certainly did not expect to see the FA when I sat down to watch that installment.

Pretty awesome footage. I watched the film they put out last year (?) about projecting the route.This discussion shows that there is no useful, objective metric for how hard a route is. # of attempts, # of repoint attempts, # of sessions, # of days, etc are all quite subjective useless without context. It seems to me that the only way to understand the difficultly of the route is to up your game to the 5.15 level and send it ...Great job Jakob.

Jakob Schubert - https://www.instagram.com/p/CxtCl5Lo58g/ TLDR - B.I.G., formerly known as project big, went at 9cTook me a while to sort out my thoughts about my most important ascent so far.I’d like to start with a huge shoutout to @adam.ondra for bolting this incredible line and inviting me to try it with him. It was such a cool process and in the end it does feel like a team ascent to me, since we helped each other so much and figured out the route much quicker that way. I‘d have never been able to send this beast without you, Adam and fully appreciate the effort that goes into finding and bolting such a king line Without a doubt, B.I.G is 5 stars and I can’t wait for more people to try it!My reflections regarding the grade: When we started trying this route last year, I initially thought it could very easily be 9c, but after making a lot of progress very quickly and feeling pretty close on it after 2 weeks already, Adam and me both were pretty confident it’ll be 9b+. But somehow we tried a lot more and didn’t make much progress and in hindsight I don’t even think we were actually that close, because we were mostly struggling to stick the crux move and believed to be in for the send once that happens. Knowing how my attempts unfolded this season puts things into a different perspective, as I stuck that move four times without sending.My reference for 9b+ is Perfecto Mundo which I sent in about 3 weeks of work and which felt way easier to me than B.I.G. The only other guy who tried B.I.G. a lot is Adam and I’m happy he shared all his opinions with me which definitely helped me draw my conclusions.I felt at a point where I had found the most efficient way possible for me, the whole route was worked out perfectly and I didn’t see any room for improvement. So all that it came down to was my physical & mental shape which I think are very good right now. Given the current information that I have and considering Adam’s opinion, it feels right to propose 9c and I’m looking forward to see what time will tell. You can find some more specific thoughts on my profile on @thecrag_worldwideAnyways, the one thing I know for sure is that it will always be one of my most memorable ascents Adam Ondra https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxvax5ft-F7 TLDR - agree with 9c

I’ve seen a lot of speculation that Silence could be harder than 5.15d, and I tend to think this route could help confirm* that, especially after reading Ondra’s comments.*As subjective as all climbing grades are, seems to be almost impossible to scale climbs at the cutting edge at this point.

Ondra sent Silence, Schubert did not. Schubert sent BIG, Ondra did not…Ondra’s comments also didn’t allude to anything harder than 5.15d, and in fact I could interpret them as BIG being easier than 5.15d due to Ondra’s comments…doesn’t he specifically say there is no move harder than like 8A+ and that it “might not sound like 9c to me”…?

Look, I think you all should get back to sharing your stoke. There certainly is nothing wrong than that.Climbing is fundamentally about overcoming adversity and personal limits be it one man's local choss or another man's Project Big. We might use subjective ratngs to come up with objective ratings for climbs...but that does not mean it isn't way harder for some than others. Everyone's limit is their 5.15C that day.Take your joy where you find it but remember that someone overcoming ie severe life-threatening asthma to be a successful climber (by his own measure, no other's) might mean just as much as a new 5.15C by someone with every physical gift and sponsorship. They may have both worked as hard (perhaps in their own way) and you should take just as much time to recognize one as the other, imo. Then take that hard work by those seemingly ordinary around you overcoming their profound fears/challenges/circumstances and be as inspired to overcome your own limits which are likely assuredly far below some other's. But eventually, it's just you alone and your personal highest peak. Climbing is an individual journey we take and most often with the support of others. If you take the time to look, people all around you are "climbing 5.15" and are great sources of inspiration.  Don't assign value to big numbers alone. That is what I am trying to communicate.

Howdy y'all,I got a wild hair the other week and, after crossing my 1000th pitch mark, decided it might be time to take a look at what goes into bolting a new route. I'd always flirted with the idea that it'd be really fun to learn to bolt eventually, but I always disregarded as a bad idea for someone with my experience level. I thought it could also be a good way to give back a bit to the community. So, I went down the bolting rabbit hole.I've read the Bolting Bible by HowNot2 cover to cover (and some specific sections a few times), watched a couple hours of videos on YouTube, spent a couple hours at a climbing shop going over various bolt types, techniques, ethics in my area, etc., and have done another 4-5 hours of reading online and around the MP forums on it. It sounds like I've got someone in my area that's willing to take me out and show me how to go about bolting. I'm also gonna pick up some big rocks to do a couple of practice bolts on before I commit to bolting a new route. Ideally I'd like to go out with a local org to do some rebolting first, but we'll see how that works out. The crag that I'm looking to bolt will eventually be buried by a mining company that owns the land but currently allows climbers to climb on it. So if, god forbid, I dramatically fuck up my first route (or it sucks in general) it'll eventually be buried anyway and won't stand as a testament to the arrogance of a turbo gumby bolter with a drill.The rock at this crag is volcanic, and I think would definitely be best served by using glue-ins. I was intimidated at first by glue-ins, but the more I've read the more comfortable I'm feeling with it. I think I'm going to use wave bolts for the first couple of routes.This brings me to a couple of questions that have been hard-ish to find solid answers to.1. What does a full starter kit look like? Here is kinda what I'm thinking currently -- what am I missing?:Caulk Gun - $25Spare Mixing Tips/Nozzles (10x) - $16Knife - FreeDrill (Bauer 20v Rotary Drill -- well reviewed by other bolters on MP and a great budget option from Harbor Freight) - $80Drill Charger - $358 Ah Battery - $100Drill bits + Spares (3x) - $30Safety Glasses - $5Pipe Cleaner - $5Balloon Air Pump - $5Rubber Hose (for Air Pump) - $3Pipe Cleaner - $5Paper Towels - FreeWave Bolt Adapter (Smart if using wave bolts) - $40? (optional?)Garbage Bag - $1Glue Gun Bag (Plastic Sack or 2 Liter Bottle) - $1Rubber Mallet - $3Hammer - $35 (do I need a climbing specific one -- I'm a bit confused about this? I understand the metal transfer from the hammer to the bolt is a no no, but I don't understand why a climbing specific one is better besides having a carabiner attachment. Those are like $70-$100)So ALL-IN for just the tools and general materials I'd need to bolt my first 2-3 routes, I'm thinking it'll be close to about $400. That's not crazy bad -- I know I'm cheaping out a bit on the drill, but I'm comfortable with it for getting started. Seems like I could do a 2nd battery, but I think the 8ah battery will definitely get me through 1 route a day.  2. How the hell do y'all minimize costs? Specifically:Drill Bits? Where are ya buying these for cheapest? I didn't realize that you chew through bits too. Sounds like you can get roughly 8-20 holes depending on rock hardness? I've read that the quality of the bit really doesn't play as big of a factor and generally isn't worth the large mark-up. Has this been your experience?Bolts? Is there a way to get wave bolts for any cheaper than about $7 from the official site? Do people buy bulk orders and get them at a special rate?Holy shit -- bolting is expensive. I've got a new found appreciation for long term developers. How do y'all fund it? Is it always just out of your own pocket?3. Is there something else I should do or any other big facts you feel I should be aware of before I go and bolt my first route? I'm open to any feedback or suggestions regarding this and would love to hear any pro tips or things you feel you learned over the years while bolting.Thanks!

Let's hear some stories of domesticated automobiles biting off more than they can chew in the wild. Where has your little car gotten in over its headgasket on the way to a climb? Bonus points if it survived.I'll start. 2016. En route to the King of Pain, my buddy's CRV broke through the ice that we had just watched an Outback drive across successfully. Simian see, simian do.Heidi picked us up hitchhiking and sent one of her cowboys to tow us out. We were able to make it back to Durango. Next trip we brought her and her crew gift cards to their favorite watering hole.

I used to drive a 2006 Chevy Malibu hatchback named Sunny. That thing was an incredible car. Front wheel drive, no computers, tons of space, and it had a 6 cylinder engine so it could haul like no one’s business. Also it looked like a granny mobile so was not on anyone’s radar.  One time I was driving through Colorado on my way to hike a 14er enchainment. The road to the parking lot was long, arduous, and most certainly needed 4wd. Well my little Malibu was up for the task. With some very careful thoughtful driving I was able to take the car up into the parking lot. To my amazement there were 4runners and Tacomas that didn’t even make it up to the parking lot. I had several people ask me, “how did you get that up here?!?” I responded, “getting up is easy, getting back is going to be the real challenge.” I miss that car. In a sea of Tacos, 4Runners, Teslas, and Subarus it stood mighty. Not the most outdoorsy looking vehicle, but Sunny made it through all kinds of disasters and is still going strong with a family member.

Just hillbilly pinstripes from narrow "roads" and some shopping carts in parking lots encounters adding further defoliation. It's definitely been party to, and enabler for, quite a lot, though, with and for my climbing friends.Best, H.

We got an older sedan style Subaru Outback most of the way down Schnebly Hill Road in Sedona. Most of the time you'll only see Pink Jeeps, with their massive clearance and AWD, out that direction. Probably saved us 30-45 minutes on the approach that day.

My buddy Bear got his drivers license at the ripe age of 34. He had a little bit of practice in parking lots and such but lacked any real dirt road experience. Naturally there was no better time than the present 40 miles down a dirt road some where in near the border of Utah and Arizona. Bear jumped in the drivers seat Paul and I tipped our heads back to catch some zzzz’s. “ keep it on the road” I unknowingly foreshadowed as I drifted off.The sound of a pitter patter of sand and gravel woke me up, followed by a bucking bronco that really got our attention. Opening my eyes all I see is red sand and brush flying. I look over and Bear is Tokyo drifting Ruby the trans American suby like he’s Bo Duke. Paul’s gripping the oh shit handle for dear life. Strangely the three of us are silent, dirt and sand flying as Bear managed to drift that pony back on the road but in 180 degrees the wrong direction.The dust and sage brush settled as we surveyed the damaged. By the grace of Jah the tires weren’t hissing, the oil pan and drive shaft intact. With several hours of unknown dirt road to go we all nodded and jumped back in. “ sorry” said bear, “ that corner go away from me.” Yeah. The tense miles fell away without a break down or flat tire and we hit pavement. The sigh of relief was audible. “ no more dirt roads” Paul said. Agreed. There was still 2000 miles of highway to go.

Oh I've got two of these!1) Good old Subie had 60k miles on the tires and I was planning to replace them that week. Instead I saw a bluebird day and went up Hyalite alone. Two minutes before the parking lot, another car is coming down, so I move a foot closer to the side of the road. As soon as I slowed down, the car slid directly sideways and luckily got hung up on a tree. Some friends in a serious truck stopped and tried to tow me out to no avail. I eventually caught a ride out and convinced a tow truck to go up Hyalite at night. Every couple minutes as snow fell, the driver would stop lecturing me on Trumpism and say he's not sure about this, then I'd gently poke the bear and he'd go back to ranting. Finally, we made it, he pulled me out, and I thanked him profusely. The one little dent I got from hitting the tree, I didn't even fix. Subie is still doing dumb shit to this day.Lesson learned: Replace your tires and stand your ground on icy roads2) The one I don't have pictures of a friend and I tried to rally into South Mineral Creek with a foot of snow on the road in my '04 XC90. Halfway in we're considering calling it and the AWD goes out; just literally dies. We spent hours digging trenches to make a turnaround, but it worked. Drove out and went straight back to Ouray to the hot springs.Lesson learned: Maybe I need to stop rallying these vehicles up winter roads on worn all-seasons...EDIT: Wait, no, I have three lol3) As a baby (read gumby) climber, I rented a Smart car to drive from Madrid to the Pyrenees for a solo winter backpacking trip. I still remember getting passed on every steep hill as this tiny car threatened to give up and take a siesta.

Great stories!  When I was about 25, my buddy and I flew down to Baja, Caliornia, rented a mini-sub-combact two-wheel drive car, and took a road trip through the Mexican peninsula.  Along the way, we spontaneously met a spanish speaking bike messenger girl from new york city who had ridden accross the country on her messenger bike, using sunglasses bought from a garage, and black plastic garbage bags as paniers.  We loaded her bike and stuff into the (now ver overstuffed) mini sub combact, and kept going.  The highlight was driving over a narrow dirt track, from the west coast of the peninsula, across the spine of mountains, down to to a remote beach and fishing outpost usually accessed only by boat.  That journey acorss the mountaisn took about 10 hours.  It involved much moving of rocks, filling in of ruts, and pushing and pulling of the car to get through the steep, rocky, rough, dry terrain. It is an absolute miracle that we did not flat, fly off a cliff, or just become stranded and die of thirst/starvation.  There was nobody else back there, except a truck, we heard, that came once per week.  I think that the short wheelbase of the car actually helped, because we didn\t get caught up (too badly) on rocks and ruts.  Later, in a different part of Baja, we raced along the sand flats, windows open, wind blowing through, landscape dry and bare.  I loved driving that car.  You just had to let the wheels drift a little and "find their way" over the loose sandy ground, and it worked really well. I'll never forget that trip--it had a feeling of real freedom and adventure.  And out little car was a big part of it!  I'll never forget the look on the rental agency employees face when we brought the car back, covered in dust, salt, grime, and so on, odometer showing some serious milage, air filter absolutely clogged.  If I can find some old pictures, I'll scan them and post them up.

Walking through it quickly renders your shoes into "platform shoes" with five inches of mud underfoot. Bikes become inoperable after just a few pedal strokes. The stuff is heavy, too. It can't be easily sprayed off when wet and instead requires scraping, or letting it dry and then chipping it off.

My first car was a 1967 VW Kharmann Ghia. Never changed the oil on it but it never complained and never left me stranded anywhere. We took it up to the top of Shaw Butte (Phoenix, Arizona) regularly, loaded down with two hang gliders tied on to the roof and three of us crammed inside with gear, harnesses, etc. That thing did pretty well on supposed 4WD roads. Maybe a statement about VWs in general… low gearing, maybe? (And careful placement of the tires as you drive… along the high points.)

What's the deal with those? Are we just talking red clay?This is what adobe mud can do:After selling this truck, I ended up with a CRV and while visiting family in BC decided to go up to Mt. Slesse for a hike with a friend. The access road was a little on the rough side, but the CRV made it with careful driving. Coming down however, I went a little too fast over a water bar and a protruding rock just in the right place smacked the oil pan and put a 3/4" hole in it. We were able to coast down a little ways with the engine off, and then push a bit until it got too uphill. Fortunately we were able to get cell service and call a tow truck, and we had gotten to a point where the road was smooth enough for the tow truck to get to the car. He dropped us off at a Canadian Tire parking lot in Chilliwack and my dad and I came out the next day with some steel epoxy and steel mesh to patch it up. To our surprise, it worked and mostly held oil with just a drip here and there for probably another 10k miles, before I got rear ended and the car was a write off. The AC also had quit, so it was good riddance to that pile of metal. I also have busted the radiator fan from a rock on a VW Jetta while driving up a gravel road in North Carolina; I think I'm just not a good enough driver for low clearance vehicles and now own a Tundra that's been amazing to me.

my buddy Peter is a man of many talents. Driving was one of the legal ways Peter made money and he usually had to drive oversized logging trucks. Be it tiny roads in Atlanta or dirt roads in rural North GA Peter really could turn a wheel. When I first met him he was driving a ‘02 Chevy Impala. Our first trip to the Red we took that car, $40, and Tortillas. we ran out of money before we got there but we scraped by thanks to the lack of a dumpster diving policy at Miguel’s.much has already been said about the hill coming out of the lode area, but I’d like to report that that  Impala sang it’s way up that hill in the rain even before they freshened it up four or five years ago.Pic is the death of said impala, frozen in the GA clay

When Elliot and I went to Norwich Ledge for the first time it was mid-April and there were still 1 foot snow drifts on the hilly dirt roads. All was swell until we started plowing up a hill through deep slush. Couldn't make it up or reverse out. Elliot was resigned to spending the entire day shoveling a path out, but I found some birch bark to slide under the tires and get us the traction to blast out of there. Probably would have been better if we just stayed stuck and didn't have to experience the choss kingdom that is Norwich.

I took gMaps' suggestion for getting to a crag somewhere near Canada. I ended up getting suckered into an ATV trail and before I could find a spot to turn around, the Fit got high centered.One wheel was in the mud, the other wheels suspended. After trying other solutions for a half hour, I ended up jacking up the driver side even higher to push the other side into better traction. I then drove off the jack -- kachunk!We escaped without anything more than cosmetic damage, and I managed to send a sport route on gear, so all was well.

I must echo the praise of the Honda Fit. Mine is first year, first generation (2007). I never did swamp it in the wild because it is very capable yet I know its limits. I did, however, leave the highway backwards at 60 MPH just outside of Corinth, Mississippi after an icy bridge. Completed a full 360 by the time I came to a stop, hopelessly stuck 20 feet down a steep embankment. Never underestimate just how icy a bridge can get when the road is dry.

I used to try and set personal speed records driving to/from the Peabodies in my 2005 Prius on Buttermilk Road during un-crowded times. My 'official course' ran from the cattle guard where the pavement ends to the little ditch just before the Peabody parking, or vice versa. I think my personal best was about 7 minutes flat, which I probably won't top for a bit given the road's current state (and the feeling that i'm long overdue for a popped tire). I know this was stupid on many levels, but there's no sweeter pleasure than ripping the Pri past a gripped Crosstrek that's clearly being taken off-pavement for the first time in its life.

Fun thread!  Following my post above, I decided to get out my old diaries and pictures, look at some maps, and figure out exactly where we took out little blue rental car so long ago. The most amazing part of the trip was from the town of Guerro Negro on the Pacific Coast across the mountains to the remote beach of San Francisquito on the Sea of Cortez.  As I said, it was crazy, and it's a miracle we made it.  Here's a quote from a web site but, bear in mind that the conditions 30 years ago were likely much worse!"Not only is San Francisquito a remote outpost, it is very hard to get to...The best road is through Bahia de los Angeles where the pavement ends some 400 miles south of Tijuana. The 85-mile dirt road south from the Bahia has been graded and now takes about three hours. It is so rocky, most locals drive dirt tracks off to the side..The other road, from the old mining town of El Arco, is worse. El Arco itself can be reached off of Highway 1, south of Guerrero Negro. The town is about 25 miles from the highway and while some maps show that road to be paved, the pavement has worn off years ago and is so rutted most people drive the dirt road alongside it.  It’s not too bad to get to El Arco, but the 50 miles of dirt road northeast from there to San Francisquito takes about three hours and is recommended only for high clearance vehicles. There is a high crown most of the way, and there is one spot called La Cuesta de la Ley that will tax the skills of most drivers and their vehicles. It is a vertical rocky drop of 400 feet in only .40 of a mile...."Here is a picture from the trip, including my friend and I, and the Puerto Rican girl we met, who had biked there from New York City. Our little car fit the three of us and her bicycle!  It brings back really nice memories of an amazing adventure and the freedom of being young.

I used to drive a 2006 Chevy Malibu hatchback named Sunny. That thing was an incredible car. Front wheel drive, no computers, tons of space, and it had a 6 cylinder engine so it could haul like no one’s business. Also it looked like a granny mobile so was not on anyone’s radar.  One time I was driving through Colorado on my way to hike a 14er enchainment. The road to the parking lot was long, arduous, and most certainly needed 4wd. Well my little Malibu was up for the task. With some very careful thoughtful driving I was able to take the car up into the parking lot. To my amazement there were 4runners and Tacomas that didn’t even make it up to the parking lot. I had several people ask me, “how did you get that up here?!?” I responded, “getting up is easy, getting back is going to be the real challenge.”I miss that car. In a sea of Tacos, 4Runners, Teslas, and Subarus it stood mighty. Not the most outdoorsy looking vehicle, but Sunny made it through all kinds of disasters and is still going strong with a family member. I also had one of those and would take it way out and only see trucks. It was even funnier when I had kayaks or a canoe strapped to it

Road was in decent condition and fairly navigable up until a steep up/down section. Was still mortified the whole way.

In 100k miles of driving my car to the crag I've only had 2 non-routine expenses: a popped tire and a damaged brake caliper, both of which were due to speeding down rocky dirt roads that were easy to drive at speed. I guess it only takes one unfortunately-oriented (or unfortunately-flung) rock to mess your car up. Done plenty of 4wd roads at slow speeds without issue and plenty of plain dirt roads (pothole-y as they may be) at speed, both without problems, but the rocky-but-smooth roads are trouble, especially when they're long so the incentive to speed is high.

 Isa gets scared occasionally and gets out and walks. the astro van was amazing. Not super great clearance but really good AWD. It banged and bounced a few times but I don't think I ever broke anything from a single hit.  the cumulative stress of lots of dirt roading had me replaceing ball joints , pitman arms, tie rods and rebuilding the front diff but she went 240k before I sold her. Isa took this shot. she definatly did not think we should have gone through here ;) I find that western dirt roads are on average  much rockier than our dirt roads in the north east. once mudd season is over we pack down to a pretty smooth surface  other than the pot holes and occasional washboard section.  there are many dirt roads here in the NE that I can comfortably cruise at 40 to 50 mph. out west there seems to be a lot of roads with loose sharp rocks that give a very rough ride and threaten to puncture tires and keep my speed down to 25ish.

Put together the cost is high, but broken down not so much.0w-20 I can get here for $60 on sale, a filter $12 for the good ones that last 16k km or 10k miles. The shops I know will use cheap shit and I have to be back in 8k kms. So I'm already doubling the time between oil changes here.If I bring that stuff to the shop, the change itself is $50. Worth it for the time and disposal. I'm really slow at changing my car's oil. Plus I don't have to get dirty crawling around the underside of my car.

Taylor, one time the rubber gasket from the old filter got left on the car, so the new filter didn't seal properly. Left a 2km long oil slick on the highway when I drove it next. Wondered why the engine smelled funny.Fixed it the next day, engine is no worse for wear.However that story doesn't involve climbing in the slightest. My apologies.

I just got back from a overambitious vehicular adventure so I’ll share. Took “The Pickle” (horrid green transit connect) out on a forest service road in the dark, looking to scout a crag and do some fishing. Due to the heavy snow year, a gate that marked the end of the road had been destroyed and removed so I happily went around a corner and straight down what turned out to be a ski run. Traction control on or disabled, the van wasn’t getting out with out some help which was delayed until noon the next day… minor adventure but my first in my van.

Glad you made it out! Cheers to more adventures (and survivable misadventures) in The Pickle!

This rental sedan made it into Black velvet canyon and many other places.The crown Jewl achievement of that trip was getting her out to Turo weep.  60 miles deep. if it had rained, we would have had to sit tight and wait for the clay to dry.We took her through the car wash before returning but the guy working the Avis return @ LV airport at 4am was sharp.  He looked under the car thoroughly and put his hand over the exhaust to see if we had been wheeling it too hard.

The Homestead guidebook has sat on my computer since its inception in 2013. Slowly I chipped away at the glam shots, the layout, and the assurance that climbers would have access in the future. Before that, our crew was too busy establishing routes to even consider this project.I am happy to announce it is finally complete! I also want to thank the community that helped me take it to the finish line with amazing stoke to rig ropes, test out beta, and patiently count bolts for me. Order now in the bookstore on my website for Cochise: Homestead Guidebook and it will ship mid-November.May this book lead you to some of the finest limestone climbing in central Arizona and a place that held me captive for many of my best climbing years, Tanya

With all the posts lately about nuisance dogs, I thought maybe we could share a bit about the dogs we know & love. Examples A, B, & C: Tucker Half-Ear, Juan Snow, & Bailey - all rescue dogs and all awesome. The first two we found starving and beaten on the side of a road far from anything in northern MN. Couldn't ask for nicer, more well- behaved critters. Adopted Bailey from my folks (who'd adopted her from the streets of Kona) once she got to be too much for them. She has the biggest heart of anyone I've ever met, human or dog alike.Example D: Sophie, a purebred wack-a-doodle. Seriously the most awesomely ridiculous dog in the history of dogs. Sophie, may she rest in peace, was best-known for doing a flying superdog leap with belly landing at every mud puddle and a huge ol' grin on her face. My kid & I found her starving in a wash at Red Rocks, NV, a common area to dump dogs.I'd love to hear your lovable furball stories! Bonus points for pics.

Louie! He had the quite the fan club at the Gunks back when we lived in NY. But he is older now, deaf and has no teeth.  Plus, very few people leash their "well behaved" dogs here in Vegas and poor leashed Louie gets pestered. At 15, he does not enjoy that anymore. So, we leave him at home (being able to have a doggie door in Las Vegas also helps). But he still loves hiking. Here he is over 11,000 feet; a 10 mile, 3400 foot hike. At 15! All under his own poodle power.

Real property?  Kinda.For ages folks have estimated how much time they will need - or think others will need to do a route and get back to the conveniences of civilization. The overall route influences these estimates.But it is also partly a property of the folks doing the route.  Reminds of Fred Becky’s bivouac in the middle of Solar Slab, RR only to later learn the FA was done earlier by Herbst+ in one day.No?

I think that climbing grades give people arbitrary goals based on a number that isn’t necessarily reality.Grades very so much by location and even from Cliff to Cliff within a state they’re not necessarily based on reality.5.10 friction climb is a completely different thing from a 5.10 sport climb which is still different from a 5.10 off with. But it gives you a starting point.When I started, climbing, we had no guidebook, so grades were kind of a relevant. We looked at some thing and tried to figure out if it was protectable, and then we would try it.

Of course grades aren’t a ‘property’ of the rock. They are a human ‘interpretation’ of how difficult it is for humans to ascend a particular piece of rock or a mountain—an effort, never totally successful, to create a consensus as to that topic.Grades initially were intended to provide potential climbers with some information to assist them in determining if a given climb was within their ability/ experience level, but almost immediately also became a competitive or ego-enhancing metric.

To get definitively technical, The steepness and features of the rock are intrinsic properties, but the grade is an extrinsic property of the rock because it wholly depends on the gravitational field in which the rock sits.   Hope this helps. ;)

But what’s the alternative then for the long-haul climbers? I’ll assert that assigning numbers of days or fraction of one day is too specific of a unit to be practical.And Colin has not clarified that he meant other than the traditional definition. Colin?

Just Venting Last week of a 4 month road trip had us spending our final 8 days in Red Rocks. Stoked on the incredible cleanup and landscaping at Lovell Canyon. We climbed, biked, paddle boarded, back packed and hiked through the Washington Cascades, Powell River( yes to Eldrid Valley and all its mice), Vancouver Island, Squamish, REVELSTOKE, Smith Rocks( bummer, respected the bridge replacement), Lassen area, Donner Summit, Mammoth/Bishop and finally Vegas. Awesome trip..Until,Driving back to Lovell, a mile before the 160. Life can take some aggressively sharp turns and I am grateful I can relay this message. This COMMAND!Do not drink and drive. If you do and we cross paths, the life you know now, will vanish. I promise. My sprinter, that I purchased from a super cool cat that I believe does a little contributing to our community( Thank you Nate Lile’s) and spent a few 100 hundred hours and a few bucks to be comfortable living in full time,No longer serves me. It plowed into a Honda Accord that decided to turn left while traveling in the opposite direction. Head on. We were going 50, he was probably doing the same.We are ok. He, most likely, not. My foot never made it to the brake pedal. After my partner’s ambulance ride to the hospital, she endured her examination while listening to officers interrogate the drunken idiot who almost ended all our lives. I have no idea what sort of life this fellow has experienced that had him choosing to be in that place, at that time, in that condition. And, as grateful as I am to be able to continue the amazing life that I have busted my ass to create,I’m just a little pissed off.Do not drink and drive on my watch. Trust me. It will not be worth it. Tim

Crozzle seems to be found most often on limestone, which by it's water soluble nature can weather to have a rough surface of somwhat-breakable spiky bits. Not the most pleasant surface to hold.Though the term can also be applied to other rock types too. Volcanic tuff is also often crozzly.

Crozzle is a British English term for slag from old crucible steel furnaces. Most of the references are from Sheffield - the UK’s steel city - so perhaps it’s local dialect. Crozzle is like some lavas: rough, spikey, and brittle. It was used ornamentally to top stone walls in Sheffield so it’s a short step to local climbers using the term ‘crozzly’ to describe holds with this texture.https://thelanguageofstone.blogspot.com/2021/11/a-walk-down-city-road-in-sheffield_16.html?m=1

In non-british circles it doesn't have anything to do with rock quality or choss.  I've always understood it to be a hold that is generally uneven and unpleasant to hold, like 90% of crimpers at Smith Rock.

We've all had the moments driving in the car, staring at a potential crag far off in the distance as it whizzes out of view.  In a similar vein, we have all felt a stirring in our hearts when a majestic rock face graces the silver screen.  Question is, what's the juiciest piece of rock you've spied on film?  It could be cartoon or live and anywhere in between.  Screenshots and pictures are even better. (And yes, I'm sure there will be some Dwayne Johnson pics thrown by some wisecracking young whippersnappers.)Here's a pristine slab face and tantalizing corner waiting for an FA from yours truly...(Tangled, a great film; there's something for the kids, and plenty of shots of those mossy slabs)

I'm a masters of journalism student at CU Boulder.This semester me and two other students are working on a capstone project hoping to create a long-form narrative article focused on the indigenous community and the outdoors. We are currently at a stage where we don't quite know where we should be looking or how to go about it. I would love to chat with anyone who has an indigenous background and climbs or even just get's outside in some form of recreational activity.The issue we are trying to look further into is how indigenous folk are connecting with the land through outdoor recreation and where are the gaps. I'd also love to learn more about any organizations that help facilitate these activities and if they you have any contacts that I could reach out to.Thank you!

Natives Outdoors, which I think is still run by Dr. Len Necefer, does a lot of work in these areas - their website could be a good place to start, if you haven’t found it already. I think he had an interview on Honnold’s climbing podcast, which I remember being insightful. You might also try to get in touch with someone from the “United in Yosemite” event that the Yosemite Conservancy and AAC and others put on this past summer, which definitely had some Native American-related programming, though I only know about it from Instagram.

I imagine you and I share the great fortune of having been deeply inspired early in our climbing career, by someone whose talent, ethics, boldness, or kindness (or all of the above) showed us what is possible in this lovely pastime of ours.Please share the story of a climber who truly inspires you.For my entry, I offer Kim Miller, a personal climbing hero.When I was celebrating my first month on this planet, in the fall of 1976, at the cajoling of Greg Lowe, Kim embarked upon the second ascent of Infinite (5.11+ X), a heinously unprotected steep slabbing test piece on the Clamshell, an immaculately sculpted piece of stone at the City of Rocks that demands such an impressive combination of technique and boldness that the route accumulates decades as rapidly as it does repeats. With its fierce reputation, the line attracts far more admirers than potential suitors.Since then, Kim has put up first or early ascents of difficult lines across the world, with the City and the Dolomites remaining perennial favorites.But it’s not just the hard ascents that I find impressive. Rather, it’s Kim’s capacity for perfect joy in moving over stone, regardless of the grade. If you see Kim, prepare to see a smile.Over the past fifteen years, I’ve seen Kim at the City numerous times, and though we’ve enjoyed an online dialogue these many years, until last week we’ve never talked in person. He’s hard to track down—he’s always climbing! So I’ve contented myself to silently appreciate each chance to watch a true master at work.A great many of you know Kim, have climbed with him, and have enjoyed his hospitality. I’ve posted this video of Kim climbing Skyline before, but I never tire of it. If you can’t find his sheer joy contagious—ha, of course you will!Kim, thank you for the inspiration. May you have many thousands of feet of climbing ahead of you. I’ll see you in the spring! I'll try to keep up!Friends, who inspired you?

When I was first getting into route development I messaged a lot of SF Bay Area developers asking if they wanted a mentee. None were interested. I really wanted to message Jim Thornburg but he's like THE GUY in bay area route development, it felt a bit like asking if Chris Sharma wouldn't mind helping me with my free climbing. Guess who finally was helpful when I worked up the guts to email him? Jim fucking Thornburg. You know who spent hours over email giving me guidance and providing insight and helping me with local climbing drama? Jim fucking Thornburg. And, when I made a huge mistake and had to chop an entire route of glue ins, you know who showed up with a cordless angle grinder? Jim fucking Thornburg. (I later helped him chop one of his routes, which made me feel a bit less embarrassed) Also, I was thinking of getting around to doing some route maintenance at Guadalupe rock, a dinky local's grid bolted crag in South San Jose. The very same rock I had asked numerous route developers if they'd be interested in looking at lines with me, but they all said that's too far to drive for a dinky local's crag. And you know who drove two goddamn hours to replace bolts at fucking Lower Guadalupe Rock? Who beat me to maintaining the rock in my own backyard? Jim. Fucking. Thornburg. That man is the patron saint of bay area climbing. He's an inspiration of a photographer, a climber, a route developer and maintainer, and just as a human. The world doesn't have enough Jim Thornburg appreciation in it.

Apogee, you forgot Aldo Leopold and Colin Fletcher. I never happened to get a mentor. I started climbing as a young lad in about 1972 at Castle Rock near Santa Cruz and all I knew was there was some guy named John Gill who could do a one finger pull-up. That inspired me and later was happy to be able to do one one-armed pull-up. But I never found a true climbing partner. So I drifted off to other pursuits and came back to climbing years later. It’s so important to have a friend who can inspire you and keep the stoke going. I wish I had found that way back when. But it’s okay. I’m having fun now and that’s all that matters.

I was a young guy working on top roping a random crag in the forest, in an area where in those days the number of real climbers was close to nil. We didn't expect anyone to come walking up, not even a casual hiker. Who should come walking up? This guy who introduced himself as Arno. He was just back from somewhere out west (Wyoming). He asked if he could climb with us. Lol, in hindsight the man was doing us a huge favor. It was us, who couldn't really climb, with him, not the other way around.Anyway, I met Arno Ilgner that day, total random encounter. I only climbed with him a handful of times but I can't understate the influence it had on me. Nowadays it's hard to even describe the utter vacuum of real live climbing experience and knowledge prevalent across wide swaths of the U.S., outside of the traditional strongholds like Gunks, Eldo, Yosemite. There was no internet, no gyms, no community; just dusty library books and a couple of climbing rags.He exposed me to the thought processes of top tier climbers. He showed me, just by climbing, the jaw-dropping boldness good climbers could bring to the game. He showed me how new-routing could be accomplished. Later of course he went on to publish his Rock Warrior stuff, but the guy I met just wanted to climb in his home state and his hunger for the sport was insatiable. My final thanks is, by example, he showed me how to dream, how to have ambition and how to make things happen simply by getting after it.

All right, I'll bite -- my climbing inspiration is my friend and unofficial climbing mentor, Phil Wortmann. Talent, boldness, ethics? Hell, yes. He's established 5.13a trad routes (Samsara) at ~ 13,000 ft on Pikes Peak, put up a 10-pitch M8 R/X route (Drop the Mic) in the lower 48 near Ouray, and continues to push the limits of what's possible. Yet he'll tell you that "yeah I gave up all the really hard shit when my son was born". Kindness? Hell, yes. Phil goes out of his way to introduce folks to the alpine and vertical adventures, and does it all in an 'aw-shucks, thanks for getting out with me' way (he is a refugee of the Oklahoma plains) when the gratitude honestly and rightfully goes the other way. If not for Phil, I'd never have taken the steps necessary to become more self-sufficient in the alpine - a dream I've had since I was a kid. He's a shining example of what can happen when folks are genuine, true to themselves, truly care about an area and its history, and legitimately care about the success of others. He's helped me to see that in climbing one needs equal parts of humility and boldness. Even more inspiring than his alpine exploits is how he handles himself personally amidst local climbing controversy, always taking the high road, always looking out for the greater good of the community as a whole. Humble, thoughtful, badass. Kudos, Phil. Beers are always gonna be on me.

I gots to mention an underrated local Squamish star, Nat Bailey. His ascent of Cobra Crack, a feat that i stumbled upon thanks to youtube recommendation, had fascinated me by the climbing and the route itself. Furthermore, while reading an article about Connor Herson (a legend who also recently ticked cobra crack & others) on Outside, I noticed the author was written by Nat. I've never personally met him but started reading more of his writings. His captivating approach to climbing and the profound life lessons we can glean from it. In the way that Nat fully embodies life, it accompanies a great depth which i believe has facilitated his climbing journey and noteworthy connections with people. In an age where there is certainly no shortage of self-promotion, which often takes the spotlight, Nat's actions speaks louder. His soulful insights into climbing and the journeys we too may embark on, are nothing short of sublime, and they hold wisdom that we all can learn from. Continuous curiosity and tenacity are inspiring qualities that make a great rock climber, and Nat possess them in abundance. His future is undoubtably promising and I'm filled with enthusiasm as I anticipate the remarkable accomplishments he will achieve!  (also brette harrington is bada$$ and is full-rounded inspiring too hehe)

 I'm inspired almost every time I get out to climb with my "ordinary" partners. Watching someone dig deep, stay focused, and try hard is always significant to me, regardless of grade or style. I've belaying my mentee on his first 5.10 trad route where he gave it everything and still whipped, and I was motivated to push the grade for myself. I've had a partner out of sight above me , well above a #6 in a overhanging offwidth, in tears but still pushing through. I think of that when my nerves flare up and it reminds me to keep on moving. Other friends, taking the time to decipher intricate sequences on sport climbs, working a route steadily until it flows for them, or dealing with a huge run out and keeping their wits about them...  Even watching some random person at the crag have a small victory is a boost for me.

I’ve got three: a legend, a pro and a local.1) Pat Ament. I first read about him in several stories in the Robbie Williams guidebook. His friendship and partnership with Layton Kor always intrigued me — I could just picture fifteen-year-old Ament reaching the belay on the first attempt at the Cruise without any of Kor’s pitons because his hands were too chewed up from catching Kor on a hip belay the day before.I admire the polymath in Ament. In addition to his climbing accomplishments and first ascents, he has an impressive aptitude for gymnastics, chess, martial arts, music performance, visual arts and writing.2) Rob Pizem. Piz has a deep, well-rounded resume of bold trad sends and first ascents. But what impresses me most is his time management. He manages to maintain an elite level of performance while also working full-time as a high school science teacher. And he’s a family man with a wife and two kids. I’ve always looked up to him for his discipline and resolve.Also, one time I was in the hospital and even though we had only climbed together once, Piz called me and encouraged me to get better and get back on the rock. A small gesture that meant a lot to me.3) Carl. My brother doesn’t let an extra chromosome stop him from doing the things he loves, including pulling down at our local gym. Although most people with Down Syndrome are born low muscle tone, Carl goes to the gym weekly and recently topped out our mezzanine wall for the first time without any takes or falls. All week long he talks about climbing … and as soon as he gets back from one gym sesh, he repacks his duffel bag and sets it by the door for the next week! Carl just turned 42 a few days ago.

I believe I ran into Kim a couple times in the Wasatch, his name is all over the book and if my old mind remembers correctly his daughter was an excellent dental hygienist and climber!My inspiration came through multiple dirtbags who just wanted to climb. Folks that would pull over on the side of the road and know the quiet spots to sleep under the stars (after pounding down a few beverages) then get up and spread the psyche to go and climb. Basically the dirtbag guides who would always be psyched and willing to push a willing n00b into trying unknown stuff.

I moved away shortly after graduation but we reconnected several years later and conversed from time to time.This past summer I went home to visit family and Phil enthusiastically reached out asking if I wanted to go climbing. Turns out the stars had aligned that spring and the ice route Total Abandon on Pikes Peak north face would be climbable, on the 4th of July none the less. Phil graciously let me borrow boots, tools, crampons, harness, and a helmet (I was was quite ill prepared seeing as how I wasn't anticipating climbing ice in July) and off we went for some freedom swings. Phil is humble, gracious, an all around crusher, and just genuinely happy to get out with others regardless of their experience or skill level.

It's really fundamental: climbers with higher strength to weight ratios will perform better.  Therefore, in a competitive atmosphere, elite athletes will sacrifice their health for performance.  It's not entirely a "choice"...I would say most elite athletes are by definition sort of mentally ill, and in this case annorexia, body dysmorphia, and so on get amplified and magnified by competition into a powerful and dark cycle. Solutions?  There are few.  Make elite competition less competitive?  Celebrate and suport and promote alternative athletes with diverse bodies who will almost certaintly not climb as well in terms of grades and athletic feats?  Maybe they could identify blood markers for REDs or other metabolic imbalances and prevent those athletes from competing...But all these solutions are difficult, and come up against the nature of strength-to-weight ratios in climbing, and the forces of elite competition.

Climbing doesn't have a problem.Eating disorders, PED use, various forms of cheating, or designing the objective to favor certain athletes other others (ie comp route setting absolutely fucking over the vertically challenged), etc... are endemic to sports competitions, regardless of sport. Those who enter such competitions, if they are not naïve, understand that these things can be present. The higher the financial gains to be had the more likely for such things to be present.

Top climbers nowadays appear to be well built, and not too skinny? Our lead setter looks very fit cruising up 5.13b, doesn’t look unhealthy at all and likely tips the scale at 135 5’7” maybe?Had two climbing partners three decades ago 6’1” and 6’2” both of whom weighed 125 pounds. They didn’t appear abnormal, but thinking back they possibly had some form of eating disorder?  BMI under 16.5 doesn’t sound very healthy?

It's ridiculous how climbers think it's such a massive problem when cyclists the world over are 10x more extreme in their eating habits. Climbers don't even register in probably the top 20 sports where weight problems/eating disorders have a measurable presence in the sport. Seriously, look at any pro cycling team or talk to any wrestler and then cry me a fuckin river.

Lot of bad takes in this thread. Do people not understand how serious RED-S or eating disorders can be? A little empathy goes a long way. Of course the MP thread isn’t going to solve anything, but it’s worth continuing the conversation. A lot of our fellow climbers are suffering. There are significant incentives in place for these climbers to cause serious harm to themselves. It’s probably most relevant in comp climbing right now, but obviously effects rock climbers as well. We need to have more conversations around wellness, mental health, physical health, and longevity. I’m glad athletes and doctors are speaking up, and it’s really worth listening to what they have to say.

While there is some presence of eating disorders in elite climbing (one very notable Italian athlete stands out as an example), the average climber (like those who are on this website), typically, are not in that category.  To the contrary most recreational climbers are no where near being below the BMI thresholds outlined in that video.  Most of us would benefit from watching our weight more!  Hard truth.

Yeah I found that video to be really interesting, it’s a real shame that the IFSC has been so unresponsive to this issue that he had to resign, he seems like an incredibly knowledgeable and competent asset to the organization.I’ve been watching world cups for several years and have definitely noticed the phenomenon-people get real light, perform really well for a year or two, and then kind of disappear. Was really sad to hear from this doctor that the negative effects of a few years of that will last a lifetime. And it’s definitely not just women-I think it’s maybe a little easier to spot in womens bodies but some of the men definitely have this issue as well.It’s definitely important to raise awareness about this issue in our sport regardless of whether it’s worse in other sports-both for the sake of up and coming athletes to understand the dangers and for the fans as well in order to try and create a climate that pressures the IFSC to take appropriate action to protect the health of the athletes. Good on Megos for amplifying this.

In every sport, people sacrifice their bodies and wellbeing. Athletes force feed themselves or starve themselves, take drugs, compromise their long term health, they train through severe injuries like broken bones, concussions, and serious lacerations and even compete through them. That's what competing on a global scale is. You wanna win? You're gonna have to suffer. That's what elite sport is and has always been, and it's fine. Climbing has only recently rounded the corner into that level arena and the climbers are saying, 'Wow that's like soooo problematic'. Boo hoo. This was the cost of entry to the olympics. It's not like athletes having short careers is some new phenomena.

This behavior isn’t new in climbing- it’s been around at least as long as there has been competitive climbing.Though it’s tough to completely eliminate unhealthy behavior such as disordered eating or doping, it’s absolutely worth making an effort. Yes top athletes are extremely driven and will often seek an edge at the cost of their own well being, but this does not absolve governing bodies of any responsibility to protect their athletes health. The rules and structure of competition can incentivize or deincentivize this behavior-in the OP video the doctor talks about how they asked setters to move away from setting pure power endurance routes on small holds because that can quickly become a race to the bottom in terms of body composition-bringing in more powerful sequences on bigger holds incentivizes a level of power which is at odds with a “lightness is king” paradigm.But if you watched the video you would know that knowledgeable folks involved feel that not enough is being done. These aren’t naive outsiders who don’t understand professional athletics-they are health professionals with decades of involvement in high level sport and access to specific granular data.  If they are saying it’s a problem-it’s a problem. Personally I was not aware that the effects of disordered eating were so permanent. Prior to watching that interview I kind of thought eh yeah it’s a good but not sustainable strategy, get real light, dominate for 6 months or a year and then wash out, go do something else with your life, whatever. But hearing in that video about how long the effects of even a relatively short bout of disordered eating can last changed the equation for me-if you are running competitions that incentivize people to damage their long term health for a short window of success and your plan is to just run through  a fresh crop of young bodies as needed, you are fucking up.

Pro athletes are our modern day gladiators, except instead of being eaten by lions, they suffer CTE, concussions, blown out knees, eating disorders, lifelong image issues, etc to perform at the highest level for our amusement.

“Climbing has a problem. There are literally people living out of their cars to climb more. People eat ramen for dinner for months on end to be able to afford more gear and gas. People sleep in boulders and under bridges to avoid getting jobs so they can climb more. Climbers refuse to get real jobs and often drop out of education and society as a whole just to climb more. Climbers often climb until injury because they just won’t stop climbing. Climbers routinely miss birthday and holidays and time with family just to play on rocks. Climbing has a problem!”

That's your argument? I'd encourage you to imagine a world larger than your own.  Consider talking to some youth climbing coaches and ask if they have seen disordered eating in their time as a coach.  Consider that when your livelihood is not tied to your climbing performance you will have to put actual mental effort into imaging that reality and how it's different from your own.  It's fine that you don't care about other climbers who exist in conditions that are toxic to them, I just don't understand why you are actively trying to convince other people to not give a shit.  You seem proud about your lack of empathy.  It's very flattering.

Oh man people are out of touch here. “Being on the edge” doesn’t mean you need to starve yourself of nutrients. Cutting weight for a competition is completely normal, within reason, but the IFSC is only putting these kinds of rules into place to make sure people aren’t making lifestyle choices that could jeopardize their lives.Moreover, I think we’ve recently started learning that extreme weight cutting doesn’t necessarily contribute positively to performance and it’s an antiquated idea. Look at the strongest boulderers in the world - the mellow guys are out drinking wine all the time and still sending V16. Emil Abrahamsson has had marked positive results from bulking and prioritizing strength over weight. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that EDs do exist in the community and are harmful. Just because you don’t/haven’t struggled with an eating disorder doesn’t mean so many others haven’t.

Teaching is as much about counseling as delivering content.  I have had many students with ED, and I have learned to recognize the signs, and take steps to help them when possible.  I've leared a huge amount, and in a few cases I've made a difference.  I've also had a students that I cared for deeply who developed an ED and dissapeared.   One girl still haunts me.  Could I have recognized it sooner?  Could I have done more?  And so on.  If you care about students you wil inevitably encounter stories like this.  Anyway, consider carefully what you write.  Behind what you might view as a casual or dissmissive attitude on this site often lies deep experience.

To be clear, competition climbing has a problem, not necessarily climbing at large. One possible solution that was brought up was to change to style of competition setting - making the climbs more burly and powerful, and less gymnastic, would push climbers to become more muscular and heavier as opposed to the super thin image that is most common today.

hot take: being underweight or overweight is unhealthy for the mind and body.  This is definitely a hot take in this thread. Holy shit. Having very low BMI for prolonged periods is not healthy and there can be regulations in place to not encourage the behavior in competition climbing. If regulations help just a few climbers, it will be beneficial. Sure people may look healthy to you, but it is very easy for a woman's period to stop all together. It's happened to me and I did not even know what the cause was because I have been naturally very thin my whole life (I was maybe 5 pounds under my usual weight). I guarantee you if you saw me at that time of my life y'all would think "She looks healthy, great. She's just naturally thin."  That is to say: I don't think you can determine if a climber has disordered eating/harming themselves just by looking at them. (maybe in extreme cases but I'm generalizing here)

Well, Ive found that dismissiveness rarely is an effective policy for improvement.  Should we not do anything about crime, climate change, etc ?   The thing is that  large, pervasive, seemingly intractable problems DO pay large dividends for small shifts of the bell curve.  Even cynics who believe that 90% of the time people’s heads are in the sand, their ass, or the clouds, think it pays off in the long term to attempt to educate in the 10% of the time their heads are in clear air.

It is very interesting to me seeing all the dismissive responses. Like yeah this is nowhere near the top 1000 most important issues in the world right now, but this isn’t a political action forum where people meet to talk about the most pressing issues facing humanity, it’s a climbing forum, a place where people talk about *climbing*.If you believe it’s only worthwhile to dedicate attention to big important issues what are you even doing here or going climbing for that matter.The whataboutism is pretty lame as well-other sports having worse problems doesn’t mean we shouldn’t address our problems, it means they should also be addressing theirs.It also seems pretty clear that a lot of folks commenting haven’t watched the video which is frustrating but I guess par for the course.I understand the idea that people should be free to do whatever they want with their bodies, and I generally agree with that sentiment. But the truth is people are free to starve themselves to improve their climbing in the short term at the cost of their long term health, and they always will be. No one is out policing bmi at the crag- get out there and go nuts if that’s your bag. Freedom should have limits however, and a good way to find where they ought to be is look at how a behavior impacts others, and in this case you have to look at the dynamics it creates in the athlete pool.The IFSC has a responsibility to its athletes to keep them safe and healthy-athletes are required to clip every draw for just this reason, athletes who routinely skip multiple clips outside don’t bat an eye at this requirement. The red s issue is precisely the same- the IFSC should not allow some athletes to put their health at risk in order to gain an advantage. As far as what to do I trust dr Schöffls reccomendation-monitor athletes for signs of red-s and bar them from competing if they show signs. As far as what we can do as concerned fans of the sport I think signal boosting that video is a great way to raise awareness and put pressure on the leadership of the IFSC.

And it's up to parents, coaches, and the organizers to look out for these young athletes.Also- everyone that feels strongly about this issue should consider emailing IFSC direcly to calmly voice their concern.

Marco Maria Scolaris, IFSC Governing Officials,I am writing as a concerned individual who values the well-being and health of athletes participating in all facets of climbing, especially those at high level competition climbing.   It has become unreasonable to deny that the intense pressure to achieve peak performance, coupled with the societal expectations of an "ideal" body image, can and has often lead competitors down a path of unhealthy habits and behaviors. Your own long time team physician is one of those leading the charge to shine light on this issue.I urge the IFSC to strongly consider making changes to the policies in place meant to protect athletes’ long term health outcomes.  As so many high level athletes begin competing in adolescence, this is fundamentally an issue of helping our youth climbers lead healthy lives… pun intended.IFSC should institute a Nutrition Program headed by a small team of professions experienced in sports nutrition.  These staff could provide mandatory educational seminars prior to each comp as well as oversee the other parts of an improved program.Increased education and awareness about the serious, well documented long term health consequences of disordered eating is needed.  IFSC should require national teams to provide proof of a minimum level of education at a team level.  Each nation’s coaches should decide what that looks like.  X number of hours per year, submitted with IFSC supplied paperwork filled out by coaches describing the program. I believe our coaches already care deeply about this issue and will take requirements seriously.Current BMI standards are not adequate.  A higher value method of body composition is warranted and readily available.  This area must be treated with extreme care.  Naturally lean climbers should not suffer as a result of any requirements.  Simultaneously, we cannot allow climbers to intentionally harm themselves in pursuit of improving their rank in the standings. Please take steps now to address this legitimate and avoidable issue.Respectfully,

But we need to remember that these are athletes who chose to get into the absolute tip top of the sport and have optimized their bodies for it. No matter what level, life is all trade-offs and I think these climbers are aware of the sacrifices they're making. They just love climbing that much. More than that, the idea of barring people from a sport based on secondary bio-markers leaves a bad taste in my mouth - see cases like Caster Semenya, who was assigned female at birth but has a chromosomal mutation that results in higher-than-normal Test levels. I think the most compelling argument for some kind of ED-based regulation is that being a professional athlete comes with extreme coercive pressure that might discourage someone from making the best choice for their health. Elite climbers might very well be in a position where they feel like they have no choice but to sacrifice their long-term health in order to keep their jobs. If you stop winning comps and lose sponsorships, you stop being able to afford rent. But that comes down to a deeper conversation about what sort of safety net our society should have.

Clickable link for the lazy, most of the commenters here obviously didn't watch it: https://youtu.be/w0Ev_b6w3GY?si=qB8QiIQmMAg00qB8I thought it was pretty interesting. My takeaway points:- They already have tests to determine if a climber can compete safely (eg they added some basic physical tests after an injured climber completed with an injured leg, that led to them breaking their other leg during the comp). He suggests BMI should be added as a prerequisite test.- The doctor notes that he sees long-term effects of the weight issues that most people don't see, since it usually appears after they're out of the spotlight (bone density, hip replacements, etc)- The doctor notes that climbers who develop eating disorders in their competition years (late teens/early 20s) typically have issues their whole lives (he cites people in their 40s)- Aside from risk to the athlete, they're also worried about comp climbers with eating disorders becoming role models and perpetuating the issue outside of comp climbing

There are plenty of comp climbers who left the competitive side and were highly successful on real rock (Patxi, Natalia Grossman, Ashima, Oriane, Ondra, Killian, DWoods, Schubert, Alex Johnson, Magnus, etc.). Though I’m not sure that is the same point you are trying to convey  You're sure that none of these climbers have struggled with disordered eating?  You must know them all very well.Half of the fad diets these days can be considered “eating disorders” by the textbook definition. I agree it’s hard to identify many eating disorders based solely on appearance, but anorexia is certainly one that can be sometimes easily ruled out in some folk. I think we can all agree Sharma or Jimmy Webb likely never suffered from anorexia. Maybe I’m wrong, but I just don’t think you can carry a certain amount of muscle mass on certain eating disorders like anorexia.

 Hey Weese Ritherspoon, Your post was heartfelt--I'll give you that.But take a step back and slow down....I apologize if my tone seemed flippant or dismissive, but that was not my intent.  My goal with my last post was to list the things I had read in the thread so far that could make a difference.  I did not watch the video.  Sometimes I like to think things through before hearing the viewpoints of others.  It sounds like the doctors were talking about providing mental health counseling.  Good idea--we should add that to the list.  Now, you've thrown some strong language in my direction.  I think you should examine your assumptions.To begin with, I count myself among the people in the world who have a "sports induced" eating disorder.  I was a competitive cyclist at a respectable level for 15 years in adolescece through my twenties.  That's basically all I did until I was about 30.  A coach I once had went around the room poking the cyclists in the group.  "All the skin on your body," he said, "Should be like the skin on the back of you hand."  He pinched the skin on the back of his hand for emphasis.  When your dreams and sense of self worth are wrapped up in how fast you can go on a bicycle, those kinds of words stay with you.  30 years later, I eat like a monk.  Mostly vegetarian.  No unsaturated fat.  No cheese.  Only low fat or skim milk.  No cookies, cakes, sweets, or unecessary calories of any kind, or only very rarely, and with huge guilt afterward alleviated by obsessive exercise.  Eating out or when traveling is hard.  I often bring my own food.  Everybody comments about what I eat.  I chronically edge near low grade iron difficiency and anemia.  Absolutely no alcohol or other drugs (except my medications for OCD and anxiety).  I don't think my eating habits are only because of sport, but I think competitive sport exacerbated and encouraged what probably would have developed normally.  So I fucking get it.  Second, as soon as I stopped bicycle racing, I became a high school teacher.  I have worked with teenagers and young adults for about 20 years. Teaching is as much about counseling as delivering content.  I have had many students with ED, and I have learned to recognize the signs, and take steps to help them when possible.  I've leared a huge amount, and in a few cases I've made a difference.  I've also had a students that I cared for deeply who developed an ED and dissapeared.   One girl still haunts me.  Could I have recognized it sooner?  Could I have done more?  And so on.  If you care about students you wil inevitably encounter stories like this.  Anyway, consider carefully what you write.  Behind what you might view as a casual or dissmissive attitude on this site often lies deep experience.  Saturated animal fats are healthy (despite being told otherwise). B12 is necessary and is bioavailable in animal protein. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is killing people.

Dave MacLeod's 2 month experiment of only eating McDonald's beef patis resulted in strength gains and improved bouldering performance. His comprehensive blood panel at the end of the experiment was better than his baseline at the start. Prior to the experiment,  MacLeod subscribed to a ketogenic diet. His carnivore diet yielded impressive results.

My name is Andy and I was a failure of a youth climbing coach.  Despite being well aware of the issue, I let at least 2 of my high performing athletes (Youth C and B ages) suffer from serious EDs without taking any direct action to help.  As I mentioned earlier in this thread, our program did eventually add content to help educate and support young athletes but this wasn't nearly enough.  Earlier in life I spent 2+ yrs in a romantic relationship with a woman suffering from severe anorexia nervosa, becoming unfortunately familiar with how deep rooted these issues can be. Influencing nearly every decision she made from about age 10 or 11.  I knew better.I should have done better but I didn't.  I let those young athletes suffer in pursuit of results- telling myself "they're just super lean, genetics" and "if there is a problem, its on the parents, not me".  They were making it to Youth Nationals after all, don't want to upset that.  Thankfully, one of these athletes is mentally strong  and has brilliant parents who supported her recovery and she's thriving.  Another athlete I still  worry about, no longer comp climbing, thinner than ever.So when I saw that the most experienced physician in comp climbing is taking up this issue, my shame made that impossible to ignore.That's one reason it matters so much to me.  Yes, there is always another problem to solve, that just doesn't make me uncomfortable.  Being bothered by people wanting to help other people, that's the hill to die on?  Or bothered by the forum being clogged up with threads they think don't matter?  I don't know, but you're right Will, I definitely crossed the anti-troll becomes the troll threshold.  It's just really hard to hear people say "stop caring so much", when I have seen the issue first hand. When the experts and athletes are saying there's an issue. And even more when the possible solutions to the issue will likely never impact those shouting "stop asking me to care about others".

I watched the video, and don’t dismiss that these disorders are an issue, but that video is a rant not a serious presentation. The Dr I’m sure knows his shit but he gives no statistics, just a few half anecdotes about a super elite group that he admits is not well measured. It’s all pretty vague stuff for so serious a disorder and I don’t think enough to go on. Cursory glances at what comes up on the first page of google research show’s competition climbing has almost the same percentage as general society and significantly less than competition sport in general. I’ve seen a few girlfriends struggle with these things so would never dismiss them as serious and dabbled on the low end of healthy weight myself. But, I think the video is more a spew at the competitive scene and the medics around it. An alarm maybe for anyone who somehow didn’t already know about it, but more useful information needs to be found elsewhere. It’s a problem but I think it’s a stretch to say it’s a specific climbing problem.

But, I think the video is more a spew at the competitive scene and the medics around it. An alarm maybe for anyone who somehow didn’t already know about it, but more useful information needs to be found elsewhere.It’s a problem but I think it’s a stretch to say it’s a specific climbing problem. Jimmy- thanks for this response.  It's really nice to have someone articulate the reasons they are dubious rather than throwing out fallacious arguments.  You make a great point that Schoffl in the video doesn't get into super specific details, recounting his entire experience this issue.  I think this is important to recognize but also to consider why.  I'm sure he has hesitation about talking about specific athletes for obvious privacy reasons.  And I think the video would be even more boring if he were to meticiously cover every instance he's encountered ED in IFSC athletes.  His words alone are not the only info we have to go on.  Allanah Yip recently talked publicly about her experience with EDs in the world of IFSC.  Treadway's docu Light includes Payne, Harrington, Lightner, etc discussing their experiences.  Given that many people suffering from EDs don't admit that to themselves, statistics are really tricky here and make up one piece of the puzzle in my opinion. I think you are totally right- it's not a problem unique to climbing.  So the title of this thread and even of Megos' video can be construed misleading.  It's a problem that includes climbing though, I think we agree.  Maybe "Society has a problem, climbing included" would have avoided some of the push-back in this thread.  Like other's have noted, this issue isn't new, it isn't limited to comp climbing, it isn't limited to climbing, or athletics. And it will never be completely eliminated.  I think Megos, Schoffl and folks like me want climbers to take it on because climbers are one of the tribes we belong to.  And it's appropriate and reasonable to begin by helping the people we already have rapport with.  Even if the trolls want us to believe since we aren't helping everyone all at once we are wasting our time.  Asking IFSC and USA Climbing to improve their policies doesn't require any of us to sacrifice anything.  It just requires enough voices encouraging policy makers to act. I think Megos, Schoffl, Yip, Treadway and others are hoping enough people speak up that IFSC is compelled to start making changes.

AM comes across really well in the video, but literally gets talked over and ignored when he asks solid questions ie what are the stats. This to me shuts the matter down as here we have the embodiment of sport climbing being ranted over by yet another expert.The camera guy too makes some good points that go joked at whilst the Dr carries on with his vague stories. The expert has just wasted what could have been the chance to allay every question raised here - makes him look like the clouded problem not the climbers.If climbers take on the role of addressing this general problem then let them do it as the self-identified expert is in the way.

Getting stronger also makes climbing easier regardless of other problems. Like I said in my previous I have several anecdotes of climbers being heavier and, consequently, stronger. Unfortunately, many people perceive lower weight as the only option to climb higher grades.

There is a difference between being permanently malnourished/anorexic and peaking for an event/cutting weight to improve performance.  "making weight in wrestling and boxing has a long history although as just mentioned that is not for performance reasons but to promote equality.  In high stakes horse racing its sort of the opposite - weight is added so they all have the "same weight jockeys".  Anyway..There is no doubt that if a week from now you weigh 5 pounds less then today you will do more pullups.  Things can be somewhat controlled by testing in formal plastic comps - outdoors the sky is the limit with what you can get away with.

I say nope as well- but with kind of a caveat.  ALL current climbing difficulty scales were developed in outdoor settings.  Indoor climbing didn't come around until much later.  Indoor climbing is awesome, and I love it- no argument there.  But outdoor climbing, in addition to being the origin of all things "climbing" including difficulty grades, is a much richer experience, therefore it's *more* real.  Route reading is much more involved in most outdoor routes.  It's in a natural setting, as opposed to a synthetic one.  More has to be taken into account when outdoor climbing, especially if you start delving into gear-protected vs. bolted routes, and particularly at the cutting edge of multipitch and alpine multipitch routes.  Now, I see what you're getting at- and I would never use the descriptor "fake climber" for Ai Mori or any climber of any range of skill or lack thereof.  It's simply a moniker that I find useless.  So equating people with climbing aside, outdoor climbing is much more "real" if I can be granted the leeway of associating "real" with needing a higher level of skill and awareness to stay safe, which I do.  The inception and the origin is outside. The skills are better put to the test outside.  Therefore it is *more* real outside.  Anyone on any national team deserves respect in my opinion and no doubt, even if some of them never climb outside, they would all put my skills (if not my knowledge) to shame on any route indoors or out.

"Real" refers to the "rock" part of "rock climbing." There are plenty of outdoor venues where climbers touch plastic rather that rock, but the climbing is not "real." [Insert insulting reference to the climbing choss-pile of your choice, insinuating that the rock is not "real rock." For example, the volcanic tuff at Smith. Notice how climbers refer to the area as "Smith" rather than "Smith Rock"...]

I think we could fill a whole book with this debate. But I would just add, trolling aside, there’s a dichotomy forming between gym and outdoor climbers, and frankly I see less and less overlap. This is not a matter of if gym-only climbers can be strong or whatever, of course they can. But it’s like - I’ll use a rowing machine from time to time, I’m not a rower. I haven’t been in a row boat in years. I guess I was in the navy so I’m a sailor, but if you stick me on a sailboat, I’ll have only the vaguest idea of what to do. And most of that idea is to not fall overboard.Sport climbing is an easy transition for gym climbers, but most of them I’ve climbed with, who are primarily gym climbers, strong as they may be, also have at best an elementary idea of how to rock climb outdoors. They can put up draws, many of them are even quite strong, and they can get lowered if there’s hooks. But ask them to rappel off a route after cleaning and it’s like you’ve tasked them with proving string theory.

My Wife and I are obviously "real" lol climbers, but our oldest Pug has been lingering and hanging on like grim death(she's still happy, but most things don't work), so we can't climb outdoors or travel the 90 minutes to Moab like we like.Now, we've been killing it at the gym for months now and we're leaving for Thailand for 2 weeks in November and I can guarantee we'll be just fine climbing most everything we want on the "real" rock while we're there.Not sure if this is even an answer to the Topic?

Seems a little odd to say I‘m going ”rock climbing at Miller Fork this weekend” as opposed to saying, “I’m going climbing at Miller Fork this weekend”…Depends who I'm talking to. Other climbers or people familiar with me — "climbing". Strangers and acquaintances — "rock climbing". Otherwise there is the inevitable follow-up question: "climbing what?"For those who think that climbing rock is the only accomplishment worth celebrating... people climb the stairs in the CN tower here. Takes a bit of effort and a lot of time, but they do it, so they celebrate it. To me, it sounds sinfully boring to spend hours trudging up steps in a stuffy stairwell where your only source of illumination is a small sliver of light from the window, but to each their own.

If you climb you're a climber. Personally I do not care what or if people climb in the gym and anyone who makes a big deal out of it is very annoying to me. But well you are climbing so if your only goal is the physical act of climbing then gym climbing may be suitable for you. That's not my only goal climbing so I just ignore the gym.

I'd argue climbing on real rock formed by geological processes is categorically different from human designed routes made from human made holds. Both are "Real" yes. Beyond that I don't understand why some kind of validation for climbing indoors is necessary in the first place. Nothing wrong with being a "real" indoor climber if that's what you want.Just don't tell me you've "conquered" anything in any case.

The thing about indoor/plastic climbing is that it lacks adventure factor. And I think that that’s why some of us, especially those of us who don’t participate in that aspect of the sport don’t consider it very real.There’s no bugs, there’s no mud, there’s no sand, no poison oak/ Ivy.  there’s no getting your rope stuck on rappel.  No falling rocks. You don’t get lost trying  to find the pink one in the corner .  So in that respect it, it is distilled down to purely the physical act of climbing. a lot of the other skills that are necessary to climb out doors are irrelevant.But it’s not really the same thing. I equate it to the equivalent of lift  skiing on artificial product to backcountry skiing  in fresh powder. A lot of similar skills and equipment, but not the same thing.

June, but the comparison to skiing demonstrates the issue quite well, doesn't it... you said it yourself, backcountry skiing, whereas laypeople hearing "skiing" probably think of a day trip to the ski hill, chair lifts, and a hot cocoa at the chalet afterwards.So to that end, why not embrace the adjective "outdoor"? This is "outdoor climbing", folks, with the bugs, beating sun, and the spending of inordinate amounts of time squinting at the rock wondering if this is finally the climb the guidebook was talking about.Trying to keep "climbing" reserved for outdoor adventures on rock is probably a lost cause at this point.

In all seriousness to the topic, I think people get too caught up in comparison. When I learned climbing from my uncle he said, "you're not a real climber unless you lead 5.9." That was an antiquated opinion from the 80s when he started climbing.I took that seriously when I was younger, but now it's like who cares just go climb some shit. I do believe that people should extend some common kindness to other, newer climbers, but newer climbers need to also understand that the world wont validate your feelings or reassure your imposter syndrome. You have to validate yourself. Not to get too overly political(lol), but you cannot expect others to have to agree with your own self image or expression. You can't control what others think.  If you only climb in a gym and want to call yourself a climber go for it, but don't take it too seriously when some person says "it isn't real climbing lolololooloolo" because their opinion should not matter to your existence. A lot of people these days have imposter syndrome and I think it has to do with the overloading of social media. Its a good topic, but I really do think it has to do with people who just want to feel validated. When I worked with teens in mental health this was something so many of them struggled with, they needed that social validation. Again you have to validate yourself.  Push yourself to do better, have fun, don't be a dickhead, and just climb your own climb. Simple as that.

With friends persuasion we got a local dude to design and make the first (to my knowledge) koozie/chalk bag.He really knocked it out of the park, zipper pocket for various things. And the koozie is removable and you can hook just that to your harness or just use the chalk bag. Comes with a belt or just clip it.Anyways just wanted to show him some love. Link to his Instagram.

2 come to mind for me.. both while developing out at Smith. First one is when I was developing my first over-hanging route and while rap bolting down, I moved a directional without clove hitching my way down. Ultimately my rope was laying on the rock for a couple hours with me swinging around below it doing all the bolty things.. After finishing and jugging back up to the new directional I set that day, I noticed the sheath of my rope completely sawed through by the rock. As I was sliding my ascender up the rope, I placed it near the cut sheath. Upon me pulling down, the sheath pulled down with the ascender exposing about 2' of core strands starring me in the face! In a panic I started sliding sheath back up the rope as best I could. Ended up just removing the ascender a sec, replaced it above the cut section, and continued ascending up the wall. Phew..And the second is a pretty sketch method I used a couple of times to get to the top of a fixed line while hanging from a fixed line of a route just beside it. Before jugging up a line I would trail up the neighboring route's fixed line as well. After finishing whatever work I needed to do on route 1, I would lower down to an acceptable height, pass my grigri to the neighboring fixed line, and just pendulum over. Holy fuck talk about feeling some g force swinging over on a static line! My own dumb fault, the last time I did take one of these gnarly pendulums it gave me a little whiplash that lasted a couple of weeks.I definitely don't endorse any of these tactics, just fun to share. Enjoy, have fun out there and don't die!

Buddy led a route, I followed as he belayed me from above. Right before I started climbing he asked me to bring the water bottle up. The packs were a ways away from the base so I untied. Some minutes later I slipped and came off on the crux section of the route, but some how managed to latch on to a knob and get back on the rock. Couple of moves later I reach a stance. I'm maybe 50-60 feet above talus, partner is on a ledge above peering down at me. "What's going on with your rope?!" He asked me, alarmed. I looked down at my tie in... I wasn't tied in at all! I was completely disconnected and the rope was dangling there in front of me.The ensuing moments getting tied back in were thought provoking. Locked off on the rope, half hitched in, retied the knot properly, got back on the rock and finished. The route, the day, and nearly my life. Always check your knots!

I was seven hundred feet off the deck jumaring my own fixed lines in a large granite area in Colorado. 11:00 at night in the winter, headlamp off to conserve battery. I felt something off in my top jug, flicked on the torch and was horrified to see ...... a 24-inch-long section of core shot that I was hanging on. The core strands were literally blowing in the breeze.I gingerly slid my ascenders past it, finished the jug out, collected my lines and drove to Mexico the next day.

There was an old established climb I rebolted in a cave.  Well I am french freeing  through a roof with all my bolting gear with me water running down my arms, I finally make it to the start of the climb.The start of it started off this large ledge, I notice there is a loose microwave sized block and I push it off with my foot, dont think much of it.I rap down three weeks later to bolt a new climb that shares the start with the thing I rebolted. I get back to the ledge and this time I sit down on the ledge. The whole ledge moves two inches and I fall off it and swing into the cave. I have my friend go half a mile down the trail as this block is sitting over maybe the third most popular hike in WA. I push it off with my foot, it was maybe the size of two refrigerators. This block then dislodges another block, I then spend 35 minutes standing on the block I am trying to trundle because there is no where else I can fit. I finally get it eventually. I hate trundling. But old people seem to think these blocks were designed benchs for a breather during the hike lol.

Now this is the content I’m here for. Not directly climbing related but close. I was scrambling around out in the desert near Moab, just exploring and looking for cool stuff in a remote part of Arches NP. I ended up about 150’ above the bottom of a canyon on a 12” wide ledge. I’m trying to climb up to the next layer 8 feet above me when the foothold I was on disintegrated. I fell about two feet and landed flat on my feet on the little ledge. I looked around, stunned, and slowly made my way back to where I’d come from.

If one climbs long enough one will collect many such stories. The goal is live to tell about them.High in the Andes, climbing solo into the clouds I came upon a crevasse. Seeing a bridge I crossed to other side. Fortunately not the other side, but could have been as the bridge collapsed into the void behind me. I continued on to the summit leaving how to get back for the return.For another, see my comment on climbing Malan's Waterfall.

A thunderstorms erupted with a flash then an instant boom. franticly down climbing fairview dome from the last traverse pitch of the regular route in a literal raging gutter comes to mind. being the cheap ass i am instead of leaving tons of cams i lowered my buddy to have him put in gear as he goes down and belay my downclimb. well on the first section in haste he failed to clip any of the few piece of pro he put in. exhilarating to say the least, thankfully he frantically whipped the rope and managed to rodeo clip a random piece so at least the ledge fall was protect for the last 40 feet.another to echo cherokee, on a classic splitter in Arkansas Horse Shoe canyon racing up one last pitch before the storm blew in I got to the chains pulled the rope up to clip and i see my unfinished 8 dangling in front of me. didn’t notice cause i clipped beneath the waist. always buddy check :)

Rope soloing at Tahquitz, just left of the Larks.  No guidebook (i just climb what looks good).  Long day.  I get real tired and weak, out of water.  I've got one pitch left in me but I'm a the top end of my rope anchored a pitch below me.  Looks like 40 feet more and I don't want to set a belay.  I'm gonna self rescue and come back for gear tomorrow.  So I tie a cordalette onto the end of my lead rope and head up.  Way not long enough.  Tie another cordalette on.  Leading up.  Still not long enough.  I've got a 20 ft piece of 1" tubular webbing.  Tie it on. Lead through. STILL not enough.  Also about out of prieces to place.  Well I anchor the end of the line and free solo from there it's just about class IV by that point.  Success.  It's getting dark, all by gear is stitched up below.  I head down the north gully descent in the dark. Back to the car, food and bivy.  Next day I head up to clean up my mess with the extra rope and gear I had in the car. Now my back is out.  Bad pain.  After getting up to the talus I have to turn around and head out.  Going to have to come back next week when my back cools off.   Came back the next week and climbed up the North Gully.  That is interesting if you've never done it before.  Rapped in and cleaned. No one had touched my gear.  Of course it was all off any guidebook trade route. Epic fun.  Proud of the self-rescue.  I don't give up easily.

This is one of many sketchy climbing moments: I was leading the third pitch of Backflip on the Bookmark, Lumpy Ridge, when I placed a piece just below the final crux. As I reached for the rope to clip, I couldn’t find it. After searching, I noticed it hanging from a carabiner about 40 feet left and down. What to do? I didn’t want to lose my precious rope, so I climbed back and anchored to the biner. I tied a good knot so I wouldn’t lose it again and continued to the top. I brought up the woman with whom I climbed a lot in the late seventies and early eighties, then blamed it on her for being distracting. She did try, however, to help by yelling after the rope fell off, which was when I was about to make the clip.

My fault: leading Pitch 2 of Walk on the Wild Side in JTree, I clipped the first 3 or 4 bolts over the first 15m or so, then missed that the route veered left, and I just continued up.  Keep on clmibing.  The rock gets a bit crumbly, little gritty noises under your feet, as JTree can be when you're not on something well travelled.  After a while, belayer yells out "5 meters".  Shortly thereafter I reach the pitch 3 anchors.(Mostly) not my fault: I'm climbing in EPC and ask a guy who seems competent if he's interested in doing Yankee Clipper.  He says yes, but can he bring his buddy along, too?  Ok, I guess.  He and I swap double-leads through pitch 8 with no problem, then guy's buddy asks to lead pitch 9.  When I finish following the pitch, I discover he's only used one carabiner to setup the "guide mode" belay, which means my the rope is running from me, up through the ATC, over the carabiner on the anchor, and then down through the ATC again to his hand.  I, of course, climbed the pitch as if I was on belay, not (effectively) free soloing it.

I accidentally skipped the 3rd bolt on my first 5.11 redpoint. The crux was between the third and fourth bolt. I was often coming off here. An easy start means this was all pretty high up. The only reason my belayer didn’t say anything is because I had just explained to him that there was a bolt I was going to skip, or I probably couldn’t send the route. The bolt I skipped on purpose was the 6th, and I have no idea how I skipped the 3rd by accident. It would’ve been awful.

In my first year I was on top of a route and set up a rappel. My harness didn’t seem right, I looked and had rigged the entire thing off my gear loop. Oops. Easy to fix then, 3 seconds later I’d have had my full weight on it. Beginners, amirite?!Over the years a few more interesting ones happened.There was the time I took a fall really run out and to the side of a dihedral on the diamond. A hundred feet before my gear would have caught me my rope snagged on a little horn and stopped the fall. 10ft super mellow slip that should have crippled me into a corner.Another time on the diamond, I was buzzing and I could feel my head sparking under my helmet. The ‘tone’ I made changed when I waved my arms around. That felt pretty dangerous.At camp 4 I went to the car to get something. I opened the hatchback then sat in the front seat and the days fatigue took over and I fell asleep. My friend came to check on me and apparently had to chase a bear off that was in the back of the car probably licking my face. Black bears aren’t really sketchy but that’s a pretty good animal story.

Kris and I were stormed off of Ice Pirates one time. With the intense rain we had on jackets and were doing the raps at full speed because it was miserable. Anyway because I had on a long jacket my rap device was hidden from my view. I normally look down just to make sure everything was ok, but not this time. In my haste I had missed clipping both strands in the ATC. Well I leaned back and WTF!!! I fell about 3 feet and suddenly stopped. Looking up at the chains I realized that the knot joining our ropes was stopped at the anchor and I was rapping on the one strand!! So I pulled back up, clipped my leash back in, fixxed the situation and continued down to Kris. I was pretty shook up about what had just happened but didn’t say anything to Kris. It was that evening when the full impact hit me - it had come down to a 50-50 chance and I got lucky. Live and learn. Now I always check just to make sure the ATC is working, holding my full weight before I undo the leash always always! This is a great topic, hopefully people will learn from some of the things we share.

Almost rapped of a piece of bail webbing that was cut 3/4 of the way through. Double checked at the last minute (literally on rappel with no back up), I was able to break it with my hand. Would have slid down a big snow slope into a talus field. That webbing is now my cord for organizing gear.... reminds me every time I touch or look at my gear how close I came to serious injury, most likely death.

Years ago when I was ice climbing more, my regular partner excitedly told me that he’d bought a new set of half ropes he wanted to break in. Not thinking too much about it, I grabbed his new lines, tied in, and off I went. As per normal half rope technique, I was alternating clips into my screws.We finished the route, rapped off, and headed back to the car, packed up the gear, and were chatting about the day. I asked him, “what kind of ropes did you buy?” He says, “Bluewater Ice Floss.” Only then did I realize that I’d been half roping with twins.

Not climbing but scrambling, maybe not totally related to the topic. I was scrambling up a talus field below Royal Arches in Yosemite, taking a day off climbing. I stop at some point to take in the view and I hear my partner say “uh, we gotta go.” When I ask why, he tells me there’s a bear 10’ away from me. Without hesitation I scrambled back to the bottom. Apparently I can scramble much faster than I thought I could as he said it was the fastest he ever saw me move.  When we got to the bottom I asked him what happened and he said there was an adolescent-sized bear lumbering out on a limb above me. Yikes.

On one of my early Tuolumne climbs, we're on Matthes heading up the main headwall around noon. Weather is blue skies and sunny. We crest the top of the headwall onto the glorious ridge only to see huge towering clouds taking up the half of the sky previously blocked behind the headwall. We start soloing down the ridge looking for the first reasonable option to bail, and while I'm on a little gendarme waiting for my partner to down climb the other side, I suddenly feel tons of static electricity buildup. My hair stands up suddenly and I start getting lots of little static shocks between my head and my wide brim hat I'm wearing. I freak out a little and jump ~6ft off the gendarme to flat ground and the static stops. We rap about 5 mins later as it starts raining, and it's a deluge by the time we're back in the woods.

Indian creek, new partner for the day, I belay them on Anal Leakage. True to the name, there's some rocks coming out of the crack as she climbs. She sends, disappears above to clip the anchor, then starts getting lowered down the face and mid-face swings a little sideways. The rope dislodges a football sized rock from the anchor ledge above. It misses her by a foot or so and harmlessly hits the deck. After she's down we realize the rope is running around some sort of constriction and despite fully hanging  on it we can't pull it down. Later we retrieve it via wavy gravy and discover that our pulling had core-shot the rope on a sharp edge. An expensive and disconcerting afternoon.

2 come to mind for me.. both while developing out at Smith. First one is when I was developing my first over-hanging route and while rap bolting down, I moved a directional without clove hitching my way down. Ultimately my rope was laying on the rock for a couple hours with me swinging around below it doing all the bolty things.. After finishing and jugging back up to the new directional I set that day, I noticed the sheath of my rope completely sawed through by the rock. As I was sliding my ascender up the rope, I placed it near the cut sheath. Upon me pulling down, the sheath pulled down with the ascender exposing about 2' of core strands starring me in the face! In a panic I started sliding sheath back up the rope as best I could. Ended up just removing the ascender a sec, replaced it above the cut section, and continued ascending up the wall. Phew..And the second is a pretty sketch method I used a couple of times to get to the top of a fixed line while hanging from a fixed line of a route just beside it. Before jugging up a line I would trail up the neighboring route's fixed line as well. After finishing whatever work I needed to do on route 1, I would lower down to an acceptable height, pass my grigri to the neighboring fixed line, and just pendulum over. Holy fuck talk about feeling some g force swinging over on a static line! My own dumb fault, the last time I did take one of these gnarly pendulums it gave me a little whiplash that lasted a couple of weeks.I definitely don't endorse any of these tactics, just fun to share. Enjoy, have fun out there and don't die! 6/10 back door brag.

I was leading a route my friend had bolted top down. No one had sent it yet. He'd gotten every move but the very end, and the beginning was so clean and beta dependent there was nothing that could chip. But we let a season go by in between and I was new to leading sport at the time. I had already gone for the last move and I stupidly pulled out rather than down, not at all expecting what happened to happen. The rock was solid, not hollow. But I pulled out a microwave sized block, fell from the top, it almost hit my belayer, it bounced off the wall hit the rope broke in half and I fell about 20 feet and got whiplash, maybe a mild concussion. Luckily he ran into the wall and didn't get hit by it. He thinks his helmet wouldn't have saved him. Luckily the assisted braking device caught me, I learned to test holds better, it reinforced the need for helmets always and I wouldn't want to be belayed with an ATC because I would've decked from 40 feet. One of us could've been seriously injured but thank goodness we were both fine and learned so much.

I do think developer stories tend to be interesting and I will tell one another developer told me. Vantage is an absolute choss pile, however it might be the single most popular crag in Washington (not the best). But everyone travels to vantage because it is climbable 3 times as many days as any other crag in WA. There was a developer famous for  going ground up on the choss but one day he decides to go out and rap bolt something. Anyway the younger developer tells the older developer to be careful with the choss as they are over a road. Old developer doesn't take him seriously, he pulls a block and it takes out the guard rail cables on the road.O then there was the time a entire climb got trundled off the wall. People looked over at this block (I was told 60 feet tall) land and there was a body under it. Everyone at the crag thought someone had died. SAR got called, the sheriff came out. Sheriff hiked in for body recovery, to discover it was a manikin. Sheriff then injured his ankle and search and rescue had to carry him out.  The first time I rapped down crag of the 20s, I was puckered as hell. No one else had ever bolted anything on the wall, and I had no reference points for anything. Anyway I spend a whole day just trying to get to the line that is now the vax-scene. The whole day. The wall is huge maybe 200 feet high and .5 miles long and I was just trying to get to this 40 foot section of clean rock. Finally after hours I finally get to what I was looking for. I am soaking wet from panic sweats and all the moisture on the bushes. I sit down on what the ideal anchor ledge should be. Well it was...... the anchor ledge had a lot of moss on it and the whole thing just fell off. Probably only a microwave but spooked non the less. I swing into the gulley since I have maybe 120 feet of rope in the system. Took me a month to go back and finish it.

I learned to climb maybe 10 years ago. Anyway after getting a little more into climbing I go out with just my friend who wants to try to send his first 10D. It was a 10d in rumney called peer pressure, it is a pretty famous route, it is essentially an overhanging dihedral traverse. If I went up there today, I would really think about placing two perma draws for cleaning it. Anyway my partner has to bail at the crux. He finally is able to swap his quick draw for a bail biner and lower off. I am lowering him and he doesn't swap his quickdraw for a biner. He says, "ill do the next one." He grabs the next draw takes it off and does not put another carabiner on. He is trollied but can't quite reach the bolt super well. I strongly encourage him to place another biner. He doesn't because, "I don't wanna disassemble my quick draw, these are the expensive ones Trevor." I am kinda annoyed but what ever. He gets to the first draw on the route and I tell him like 6 times not to grab the draw. To just lower to the ground and I will get it. He is still trollied. "Trevor you weigh like twice my weight but I will just down climb and grab it, Trevor." Me, "Can you un trolley us at......He fell, while trollied to me, and with a single carbiner of protection we swing over the belay almost killing the person looking at social outcast over the edge of cliff at Bonsai. Next week we were back out and I decked into a ledge at trip corners and some  Doctor came and wrapped my legs up to stop the bleeding. Haven't really had anything dangerous in the last 2,500 pitches though, so maybe I figured it out!

I tried rope soloing for the first time on some 5 pitch route in the Linville Gorge. After climbing p3, I fixed my rope and started rappelling down the side not running through all my gear. Eventually the end of the rope slipped through my brake hand (no knot) and at the same moment my weight must have shifted enough that I inadvertently released the grigri lever, so it locked up with only a few inches of rope hanging out the end. I grabbed onto the end of the rope as tightly as I could while swinging over to the other side of the rope running through all my gear, set up rappel on an ATC, and had to finish the route.Lots of lessons were learned that day.

I just remembered another one. 15 years ago I was going through a breakup with someone I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with. I was heartsick and my mind wasn’t on climbing. My partner and I decided to climb the Weeping Wall that day. Climb goes fine. As we’re rappelling down, first two raps go smoothly. I get to the final station about 60m off the deck. Unthread my atc, call myself off rappel and was *just* about to lean back onto my sling when I look down and see that I hadn’t clipped in to the station. I was horrified, quickly attached myself and resolved to never climb when my mind was that preoccupied with other matters.

Mine was at my local crag.  I climbed a easy 5.8 sport climb.  Had about 5 bolts or so for the 55-60ft route.  No issues great climb. Came back the next weekend and wanted to repeat the climb as  my first climb/warmup for the day.  Load my draws, tie in and start up the climb.  About 10 or so feet in I start wondering where the first bolt is and think I might be a little off route, or its coming up around the flake.  Well 20 feet in I realize, well shit someone chopped the bolts.  Non wanted free solo it was.  Not as sketchy as most but crazy for me, six days later.

That time I realized I am not attached to the anchor on a belay ledge. This also happened to a partner on a different day. I am much more careful now. And when I got nighted on a 15 pitch climb and was rapping in total darkness with a shitty headlamp. I was pregnant with my first child and climbing on my wedding anniversary. I should mention not with my husband who isn’t a climber. Glad I got down ok.

I was hoping chode rider would chime in with his lost pinkie. Anyway, he decides this mostly  gross tree doesnt really need to be alive anymore. When it comes to the ground it knocks some rock loose and then he drops a few more blocks on it. Well the tree landed in quite possibly the worst place imaginable and pretty much landed like a bobsled on mud, through the belay area. Anyway, I tell him he should probably wait for our other friend to show up as I have no idea what to do about it. Well one friend shows up and belays me on this thing I put up. I send it. Then my other friend comes running over white in his face, "Daniel had an accident, his hand isn't too good." I run over, and look at his hand, I am 99% sure he is going to loose his pinky. He started trimming the fallen tree and a rock dislodge and ran over his pinky. It is straight up pointed the wrong way and bleeding but I try to put on a good face and say it will be okay. I hike out with him and we send him off to the hospital with another friend. He texts us back, "Pinky is fine." That MF just go a severe dislocation of the pinky and decided he wanted to go climbing with me two weeks later. God dam youth.

I have another sketchy moment, scared me more than a totally unplanned fall that happened recently before it. It was a planned fall and not a near miss or anything but just so painful. I wasn't thinking because the bolts weren't far apart, but the clipping position was bad because it was a roof above slab. I got the draw in but got pumped trying to clip, I think from dropping the rope once and being short-roped the first time and maybe cold fingers or dropping it a second time too…anyway, I shouldn't have kept trying at that point but I wasn't thinking because it didn't seem like a dangerous distance. But I should've thought about how there was no way back in to down-climb and a fall from that roof onto slab would slam my knees into the wall. I ended up hanging there holding onto the draw stupidly knowing I'd have to let go eventually because I didn't have enough strength left to clip. But I knew letting go meant my knees slamming into the slab below. It was inevitable, nothing to kick out from while hanging from the roof.Taught me to assess awkward positions and not just distances.

I was leading this moderate sport route at a local crag. The defining feature of the route is a body-sized flake about halfway up. It makes for some sweet finger locks. I was working my way up it and heard a noise. I didn’t worry too much, as my buddy had warmed up on the pitch a couple hours before. I figured there were some pebbles in the crack. This crag is a new area with lots of loose rock and fairly few ascents. As I’m yarding on these locks, I feel the entire flake start to move. I hollered to my belayer to move, move MOVE, as that flake was coming off. He took in slack and I was able to hold the flake with my right hand for a couple seconds before it tumbled off. Luckily, I had a bolt clipped at eye level, so I didn’t whip or anything. Even more lucky, the rope actually passed UNDER the flake (bolt below it to the right and beside it to the left) and somehow was not chopped, or even touched, as the flake fell. Here it is at the base in several pieces. The only casualty (other than my opinion of the crag) was my friend’s jacket, which was shredded and melted by the flake.

I was on a 2 week solo trip to Sam's Throne AK and ran into a cool person who sold me 3 hits of Acid.. Not wanting to take it on a climbing day I waited till a rain day and decided to have a "rest" day.. Well I took it and when the rain let off, I decided to go for a hike trippin. So I put on my approach shoes grabbed my day pack and chalk bag... Man.. I was just floating through the trails not looking at my feet but gliding over the ground. I was floating..  Came up to some easy down scrambles and just cruised around the throne. I stopped at the base of a climb and looked up. The trees and everything where "breathing" the sun rays cut through the trees and seeing colors explode over me. I glanced at the holds. They glowed.. Everything came into focus and locked in on a target. I placed my hands on the sandstone and pulled.. and pulled and pulled. I remember the guidebook saying the crux was at the first bolt. Before I knew what happened I pulled and the bolt slipped below my vision..  I looked up and every hold looked hyper focused and clear. I remember having the thought of what the hell am I doing and it being washed away with a sense of security. I pulled the last hold and looked down at the ground 50 feet below me... What had I just done. But I did it again.. 5.9+ overhang and a 5.10c/d something walkup onsite on Acid.. in approach shoes. Wildest thing I've done climbing to date. Hope this counts..

New routing this last summer, I blasted off up a dirt pitch to see if we could find a decent anchor and connect our lower pitches to the high point a new way. Right above me was a refrigerator size block seemingly held to the cliff by a splintered, decaying tree branch.This thing was RIGHT in the way. No real way around it and the tree branches were going to keep  snagging the ropes as I tried to bypass. While attempting to find a way for the ropes to sit cleanly I jostled the branches a bit to much. This block, now directly above me and about a foot away shifted about 3 inches towards my face and gave me immediate visions of being a pancake on the side of the mountain.It’s hard to say what would have happened if it had pulled, but it would have been nasty. I had no gear in at the moment so at least a factor 2(ish) fall. My belayer was directly below me and would have surely been the first bumper in a game of alpine pinball. If this 3” splintered branch hadn’t held, I’d put good odds on dead or seriously maimed for both of us.Good times!

Darrington style climbing but in the middle fork. Your right on with your choss categories, though I will say that I have nearly dropped basket ball rocks on my partners in vantage on the less traveled walls. The main columns get so much traffic that all the big stuff has been pulled. Take a little venture out to the Lesbian Troll wall or anything across the coulee from Sunshine and you can find plenty of massive choss pieces to pull. I can’t believe they used to do ground up style out there… Absolutely heinous.

In 2010 I was putting up routes top down at a local crag in suburban Portland, "The Lost Wall," well named. Although we never saw anyone out there, a faint trail paralleled the top of the cliff, though a good 100-200 feet back from the edge. One day my partner's rope was stolen from where he had left it hanging fairly hidden on a tree between the trail and the cliff edge. Spooky, weird, but not crazy, so next time I left my rope looped around the fir tree I'd been using to rap in. Getting to the tree was a bit sketch, even for a climber, I figured my rope was safe. Next day I'm at the tree, harness on, about to toss the rope over and rap in, but I see some fuzz in the rope pile. Life-changing moment.I investigate the fuzz and see my rope has been sharply cut so only one strand still connects it. I see more fuzz and discover a second identical cut 10 feet further, again only one strand left uncut. (No way a critter made the cuts, I showed them to a few people later, they were perfect knife slices -  not to mention why would the two slices be in the inaccessible middle of the rope pile?)  As my blood ran cold, and on a hunch, I decided to toss the rope as if I had not noticed the two cuts - and both cuts disappeared over the edge so that if I had started to rap I would have been over the cliff when I hit the first cut and would have fallen around 80 feet into talus and to my death - or else the second cut would have got me even if I got past the first. Then I started to feel like someone was watching me, and got out of there ASAP with my head on a swivel.

One of my early rope solo adventures, and ironically the sketchiest part had nothing to do with the climbing or rope soloing. I had been testing out my rope solo system at a local single pitch area and was feeling ready to start getting on some longer climbs and focusing on efficiency. My first rope solo multipitch was Flake n' Bake in the lower Sandias, and while that particular climb was all safe and fine, it took something like 4.5 hours to go from car-to-car. I needed to work on efficiency and so set a goal of getting my car-to-car time down to under 3 hours. I went back to the single pitch area, worked out some kinks and practiced transitions, and returned to Flake n' Bake a couple weeks later.I was reading Rock Warrior's Way at the time, and the mantra of "if you get stuck behind a party, that's your own fault for not waking up earlier" was fresh in my mind. To leave absolutely no chance of getting behind someone else, I decided to aim to arrive at the base of the climb by the beginning of civil twilight, around 6:15AM that time of year. I woke up around 5:00AM, poured some coffee, and drove up to the La Cueva Picnic site. As I was loading up to start hiking I realized I'd left the bear spray at home. I'd hiked quite a bit in the Sandias at this point and didn't always or even usually bring bear spray, but with the combination of being alone, at dawn, and in a narrow canyon with dense early-September foliage, I had planned to bring it for some added peace of mind. I decided the risk of bear/cougar encounter was probably not that high if I made sure to make plenty of noise (not a decision I should have made prior to the caffeine kicking in), and so I took off on the approach.The hike starts off being pretty open and straightforward, but once you enter La Cueva Canyon, the trail winds around a lot and goes through a lot of foliage, which again was very dense at this time of year. I was fully freaked out through this section, certain that I was going to either turn the corner to be greeted by a bear or have a cougar pounce on me from out of the brush. I pushed through fast because I knew the trail continued up onto some slabs where I could at least see the predator coming before it took me out. As I got closer to the slabs, I felt a combination of relief and embarrassment; there had been nothing to worry about and I'd just gotten in my own head.Just as I finished that thought, I came upon a not-huge but also not-small pool and spray of blood across the trail. I'm really bad at judging these things, so the best guess I can give is the prey was something between the size of a rabbit and a deer. At this point, turning back around would mean going back through the tight turns and dense foliage lower in the canyon, so I quickly continued on to the base of the climb with the hope that a bear/cougar wouldn't come after me if I could get myself at least halfway up the first pitch. I got to the base and the climb itself was fast and uneventful. As I was making my final rappel (around the 2 hour mark) I heard another group coming up the canyon. They had apparently expected to have the canyon to themselves because I heard one of them say "Whoa, someone's already here." My final car-to-car time ended up being around 2:25, and now I always make damn sure I have bear spray on me when I'm hiking alone up La Cueva Canyon.

I was at the first belay of a multipitch, belaying my partner up the second pitch when the leader from another party pulled up to the ledge. He chatted with me while he set up his anchor, then clipped his ATC guide to the rope, but instead of clipping the metal ring of the ATC guide to the anchor, he clipped the wire to the anchor (the one you use to clip the ATC to your harness) and called out "On belay!". A little panicked I said "Is that going to hold him if he falls!?" "Oh you're right, haha I guess I shouldn't be chatting when I set this stuff up!"He told his partner to wait and fixed it, but it made my palms sweat a little.

He chatted with me while he set up his anchor, then clipped his ATC guide to the rope, but instead of clipping the metal ring of the ATC guide to the anchor, he clipped the wire to the anchor (the one you use to clip the ATC to your harness) and called out "On belay!". A little panicked I said "Is that going to hold him if he falls!?" "Oh you're right, haha I guess I shouldn't be chatting when I set this stuff up!"He told his partner to wait and fixed it, but it made my palms sweat a little. I was on the receiving end of that same mistake once.  I was climbing with a longtime, trusted partner on a week long trip where we had already climbed several other multipitches without issue.  However, every other time we had used just grigris since we never had to rap off any of the climbs.  Last day of our trip we did one where we had to rap, so we brought up our ATC guides.  Partner leads the first pitch which was pretty long at around 150 feet, sets me up on belay, and I climb up.  There's a bit of a tricky move right at the end of the pitch pulling over a slight bulge on some awkward jams but I still finish the pitch clean.  Upon arriving at the anchor I see carabiner which is supposed to be clipped to the eyelet above the device is instead clipped to the wire keeper for the ATC.  I point this out rather shocked and my partner realizing the issue apologizes instantly and is so embarrassed.  My partner was admittedly rusty on multipitch stuff before the trip since he had not gotten to climb much for the past year and had only done single pitch when he was able to climb.  Definitely spooked me a bit but we kept going, finished the climb, and had a great rest of the day.What was really funny and partly why I really didn't take the incident harshly was that as we were racking up for the first pitch, a soloist walks up on to it and starts soloing the pitch right in front of us.  This is pretty common for where we were at so we didn't think much of it.  I said to my partner as the guy was soloing, "Maybe I'll get to that level someday but not yet."  Ironically I then basically soloed the pitch unknowingly which I thought was pretty funny after realizing it.After the incident I did some research to see if it was really 100% certain that I would've been dead had I had fallen.  HowNot2 did some break tests on a few ATC wire keepers and while they didn't test the exact model we were using, the DMM pivot, others were breaking at near 7 or 8 kN which made me feel much better.  Though clipping the carabiner through the wire orients the break side of the rope parallel to the climber side when belaying from above and essentially offers no breaking ability when pulling straight down on the break strand.  Its essentially the same as belaying on the ground with the break strand held up going towards the climber.  I think had I fallen my partner would not have been able to correct the orientation of the rope and arrest my fall, so I probably would have decked.  Regardless, I survived and now have a great story to tell.

It was a low angle juggy slab so the second bounced a lot as they fell. They lived, but had car crash level life changing injuries.What's worse, they were both travelling climbers who had met recently looking for random partners, and didn't really know each other. Neither had insurance (socialised medicine only covers citizens, tourists get the bill) the perpetrator ghosted, skipped town and fled the country, leaving the victim with a huge bill.

There's two seperate partys on to seperate routes, both parties with climbers named "Steve and Mike", no lie. Steve in one party gets to the belay, ties in and yells "off belay Mike!!". The Mike belaying his Steve on a totally different route who's still cruxing lliterally takes his Steve off belay and yells "belay off Steve!!"... I watched the whole thing like a bad tv show. Getting the info with a full groundfall likely to get the 2nd poor cruxing Steve back on belay with his Mike was a desperate, but calm and fast discussion.

While working as a climbing arborist, I set up a top rope and anchored it on the trunk of a tree(with my rope redirected through a crotch in the tree above me). I asked for a rigging rope from the groundsmen on the ground and kept doing my work. Next thing I know, I drop about 5 feet and my secondary life line took all the weight. Dude on the ground UNTIED my knot on my climbing line and started screaming that he has a rope for me. I was about 60ft in the air when he did this. The only reason im not in a wheelchair right now is because of taking secondary tie-ins seriously.Another time i had a heroin addict in a skidsteer grab the end of my climbing rope in a pile of trees and tried driving off with my rope in the claws of the machine. He pulled me off the trunk of the tree and was very close to snapping my rope before someone else noticed and stopped himThese two events 100% gave me PTSD about trusting other people

My sketchiest moments climbing have never been once I was roped up. I've come closer to dying and injury on approaches than I ever have on the wall. Either from the rope snagging while on an exposed traverse, sliding out on an exposed slope, having boulders roll out from under/onto me in a boulder field, and most recently I pulled a hospital rock down on my head moving from one area to another. It was really bushy and I grabbed a side pull to balance myself which pulled an entire flake down and broke in half on my head. Luckily I was the only one in the group that had not removed my helmet. Dented the old brain bucket and gave me a hell of a neck ache for the next 20 minutes.

Haven’t been climbing that long but last weekend watched someone get hit by a brick sized rock knocked loose by wind standing 20ft from me. I had just climbed the route they were getting on, and at the time of the rockfall I didn’t have my helmet on as I was just relaxing scoping out my next climb. If they hadn’t been wearing a helmet, they likely would have died on the spot. As it was they had to go to the ER but are recovering. I don’t think I’ll take my helmet off at the base of climbs anymore, you really can just get unlucky.

Sketchiest... at age 16, trying a climb we had no business trying. My buddy took an 80-foot factor 2 fall on pitch 3--luckily high enough not to hit the ground and was able to climb again some 4-6 weeks later. (I've recounted this elsewhere on MP.) After that "come to Buddha" moment we joined a club and took some classes--what we should have done in the first place.Just yesterday, at the local gym, happened to see a guy lowering his partner with a Grigri. He was simply pulling the lever back and had one hand up high on the rope going up--brake strand completely unattended. I grabbed the brake strand and he gave me a relieved "thanks" as he switched hands... a Grigri virgin wanting to do the right thing. Reminds me that we were all young, innocent, blind, and stupid (to some degree, anyway) when we started.

Last year I was toprope soloing a route at my grade limit at a certain busy crag near DC when I felt a couple tugs on the rope, followed by the rope going slack.  Luckily I had just pulled the crux, and made it up the last 20 feet without incident (screaming "get the fuck off my rope!" the whole way up).  Got to the top to find my anchor completely dismantled!  A newish climber had mistaken my rope for his party's setup, and I think the poor guy must have frozen up after realizing what he had done, instead of just fixing the anchor.  Not a fun experience.

I posted this on Supertopo some years ago....seems like it fits the criteria for this thread.Back in 1977, and two years into the start of my climbing career, the Joshua Tree route 'EBGB's" was established. For the next two years, I walked the base beneath that intimidating block, only to experience an episode of sphincter tightening with each glance up that steep, frightening face. I finally drummed up the nerve to at least go clip the first bolt, and make half-baked attempts at the mantle start, only to weasel out. Early in 1979, I retired my green PA's, which had been acquired from a starving Brit in Camp 4 a few years prior. I managed to scrounge up enough cash to get my 16 year-old self shod with a brand new set of EB's, and I set about ticking off some routes that seemed unattainable in the aforementioned footwear. And so it was that I arrived, once again, at the foot of that bile-inducing pitch of quartz monzonite, perched high above the cacti at Echo Cove.I was using these newfangled things I'd recently been turned on to....called 'quick runners'.....slings with two biners pre-attached, and then hung on a gear sling over my shoulder. My gear sling was a simple piece of 1' webbing, tied with a water knot. Wrapped in a 2" swami belt for a harness, and having added one extra 'quick runner' to my "rack", I headed up, clipped the first bolt, and felt mighty proud to pull off the mantle and begin the sidestep left to the second bolt. As I stepped past that second clip and onto the bulk of the face, that familiar sphincter clench hit me once again, but now, I wasn't at the base......I was into the business, and as intimidated as I'd ever been in my 4+ years of climbing. Time seemed to stand still as I made my way up, finally gaining the third bolt and making the clip. From here, the climbing above looked exceptionally daunting, and I considered lowering off. But my partner Jeff's constant words of encouragement calmed my nerves, and I grew more focused. With eyes lasered in on the 4th bolt above, I began the delicate dance on the upper face. Suddenly, as I neared said bolt, I heard a clinking sound, and watched in horror as the entirety of my rack fell down the face.....the water knot in my gear sling having come undone. I was well above the third bolt, and my only other carabiner was the locker on the front of my swami, holding my stitch plate. With both hands absolutely pasted to the wall, I had no ability to reach for the locker. I began to whimper, while Jeff started losing his mind. He suggested I try down-climbing, which I could only manage a pejorative response to. I was gripped out of my mind.Minutes went by...with me resetting my feet constantly, trying to wrap my mind around a solution. Even Jeff's nerves began to fray, when finally, he nervously suggested, "Maybe you should just jump". Not wanting any part of that, I began to climb....move by agonizing move.....and further and further from that third bolt. The encouraging words from Jeff disappeared...there was only stone cold silence as I passed the fourth bolt.Minutes later, and with painfully slow movement, I passed the last bolt and forged on into ground fall territory. After what seemed liked hours, I pulled the last few moves and collapsed in a cotton-mouthed heap onto the summit....completely unable to speak. Jeff was so shaken, he flat out refused to follow the route.

I was out at a cliff alone one morning hoping to practice using a hollow block as a third hand to make rappels safer. I set up my rappel and attached the hollow block above my belay device (tuber) and started lowering. I thought this was the correct methodology from what I had read. About 15 feet down the hollow block slid into and locked against my tuber keeping me from lowering any further and stuck 60 feet off the deck. I tried multiple times to lever up against foot holds to clear the block and unclip the cord from my harness so I could lower to the ground, but could not get enough clearance. I dangled there for 20 minutes trying to work out a solution. I had brought my pack with me on the descent and knew I had a knife, so I carefully flipped my bag around and located it. Cutting that hollow block under pressure felt very sketchy under the circumstance, even though I knew I was still safe. The cord exploded under the blade and I was free from it. All of this had put me out of the mood for rapping further, so I grabbed a cam and plugged it into a pocket and gathered myself. After a few minutes I ascended the rope back to the anchor and got the hell out of there.

Given the way the gate faced in a video, it was the side of the draw that broke that did not face the sun. To answer your question, yes it had been there for an amount of time that was a mystery to me. Thinking a freak accident of it, I replaced the draw, closed the books and moved on.The route was Price for Fire in Morrison, and eventually drew feedback from someone who maybe had a similar experience, and Has since been updated with a chain draw to mitigate this risk.It was a lesson for me in being leery of project draws, and understanding that climbing on them assumes a considerably larger amount of risk than fresh draws!

This is a great thread.Many years ago I climbed a moderate trad route and my second followed  and cleaned.  It was an 80' single pitch climb and I always knot the end of my ropes just in case but knew I had plenty of rope since it was a short climb.  Threw the ropes over and as I was lowering off the tree, I was scoping out another much harder climb I had been trying to get the nerve to lead.  I was about 50 feet off the deck and I had the sudden feeling that I was falling.  No joke, I was sure I was falling and instinctively clinched down on my rope and immediately one end of the rope went through my pinky finger.  I had failed to stopper the end of the rope and came very close to tapping out permanently as the fall was nasty at the bottom of that cliff.  I had to yard up on the rope enough to get a few wraps around my leg and then almost vomited.  Whether you believe in God or not, he showed mercy on me that day as I have no explanation for the feeling I had that caused me to lock down on my ATC.I had found the middle of the rope and threw it over the edge.  The only thing I can assume is that the rope got weighted on one end and pulled it off balance.  This was the ONE time I did not tie the ends of my rope as I was thinking about the hard send that was next.  It was an eye opening moment as we had just had our second child and it really put things in perspective.  It has made me a MUCH safer climber now!  Tie the ends of those ropes and weight your rope before you break down the anchor.

Mine aren't too bad but my first outdoor 11 (first clean send on lead, I had tried others but never sent clean) was one a friend had just attempted and whipped on. The crux was toward the end but he didn't make it through. We pulled the rope and I went up to try it. I made it through the crux! Got the next bolt and went to clip. Realized I had nothing on me…no draws. I was dumb, I must've thought he hung them all and I didn't carry extras (learned my lesson). It wasn't down-climbable so I could've either taken a 20' or kept going without clipping at that point. Would've been an easy decision on easy terrain but this was at my limit. I kept going and was so nervous clipping into the mussy hooks at the top. It would've been at least a 30' fall at that point, and thank goodness this one ended with hooks. But onsighted my first 11 that way!

My other sketchy moment was my first fall on lead. Pulled a small microwave sized block at the final move. Belayer let go of the GriGri and I fell just like 15' but hard catch. This was October two or three years ago. I think I got a small concussion from my head snapping back, and the rock hit the rope but luckily didn't cut. I don't think my belayer's helmet would've protected him if it'd hit him either. What was unique about this block was it wasn't hollow, it was just caked in from mud. I'm much more careful about loose rock now.

Climbing Space Cowboys at The Planetarium, in Sedona; leader-follow situation, at my limit climbing. I belay my partner up on lead, proceed to tie in (strike 1), notice that I have too much tail (strike 2), and decide to use that fancy new Yosemite tie back that I had just learned about the day before to deal with the excess rope (three strikes you're out). I started up the climb, cruised the 5.10 first half up to a really nice ledge maybe 50 feet up, proceed to look down and see the rope untied, loosely hanging through the hard points of my harness. I quickly retied, started up the crux and immediately fell off.Strike 1: There's no way to do partner checks in a leader-follower scenario if I'm not tied in before the leader starts climbing. No one around to catch my dumbass gumby mistake.Strike 2: just get good at tying your knots properly. Excessive tail is annoying at best and as I found out can sometimes be hazardous.Strike 3: Don't tie new knots for the first time when your life could depend on it. Practice before hand. What happened to me here, is that when I did the tie back on my figure 8, I went through the wrong opening and ended up unthreading the last part of my knot, which ended up unraveling the entire follow through of my figure 8. I got lucky and I'm not proud of it.

Hi! This post is for everyone who likes mountaineering or is a mountaineer. Anyway, I am currently conducting a research in linguistics about how usage of certain metaphors can influence people's reasoning about different topics. In my case, it's the usage of metaphors related to war in the context of mountaineering (for example, conquering a mountain). I've already done the quantitative part of the research with participants (who didn't know the purpose of the study), but what I'm lacking are qualitative results. If you are interested, please fill out this google form (it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes of your time) to help me get my Master's degree. Everything is explained in more detail in the form! Thank you so much in advance for helping me advance the world's linguistic knowledge :)

I am getting a super clip which then am attaching to a 4.5 ft - 11.75 ft painters pole. I know when people are climbing and need to bail they will sometimes stick clip to the anchors so they don’t have to leave gear. My question is when you need to bail do people lower to the ground and haul up with there stick clip or do they leave it on a bolt on the first easy half of a climb. Also do people just climb up the route with it (seems a bit impractical especially with a 4.5ft pole)? Please get back to me with what you think is best! I am thinking I may just leave it on the wall on my project on the first easy half but would love to hear other opinions.

Go in direct to the bolt, pull up enough slack to have the rope reach the ground and have your partner attach the stick and pull it up. If you are very safety conscious you can attach a prussik to the rope and have your belayer keep you on belay as they’re feeding you slack. That will take a lot longer but will keep you from decking if the bolt failed on you.

The short beta stick is great for carrying on route. It has a hole in the head piece that is designed for clipping with a carabiner. On my longer painter pole I have a cord tied on the end that I’ll occasionally use to carry it on route but it’s a monster and is pretty hazardous. I wouldn’t try to free any moves with the latter setup but have freed steeper moves with the small beta stick without too much worry. Usually I avoid freeing with the stick clip at all though and just use it hang draws, get to the top of the route, or clean them from the bolt below.Some other creative options beyond carrying the stick on route:- Longer poles on shorter routes can be extended all the way and leaned against the wall if you need to swing over and snag it. Be sure that it’s stable so that it doesn’t fall over and whack you, your belayer, or other nearby climbers of course.- Bolts on neighboring routes can also be used to store your stick temporarily.- There are also some quick and creative ways that you can build an anchor using the rope and two bolts midway up a route. You could use that technique to send a bite down and haul a stick clip up (or anything else you might need). Probably worth practicing this one in non-consequential terrain first.Some of the most fun climbing lessons I’ve taught have been on advanced stick clipping techniques. Could be a great reason to hire a certified guide!!

Sometimes people climb with stick clips attached to their harness, though usually something like the Trango beta stick and not a full on painter's pole. Usually they're just trying to get the draws up for their proj and not actually climb. So they'll just go in direct to every bolt, clip, jug up, etc.Also there is the 'wimpy stick' which is basically a mini stick clip that's easy to climb with attached to your harness. You get a collapsible antenna/selfie stick, and you attach a draw with a self closing carabiner like the Kong Panic. This is a good option if you want to mostly free climb the route but might want to clip past a bolt or two. Here is Kevin Capps with instructions on how to make one: https://www.instagram.com/p/CotU4W2AGli/

I’ve got this 30 year old stick clip that’s essentially a tent pole with a plastic thing on the end that holds the carabiner spine and the gate open. Epic is the brand name. carries easily on the harness for those moments of shame. The shock cord is all stretched and worn out, so it can be a cluster at full extension, and has led to some good laughs when deployed and failed. It’s almost a point of pride to bust it out at a crag anymore, that it’s so old and barely getting it done anymore. Kind of like me

The basic mechanics have been explained in the first answer.Obviously you can only do this if you are no higher than ~1/3rd of your rope length up. If your rope is 60m, you can’t be any higher than ~20-22m up, depending on the steepness of the route, and whether there are any boulders your partner can scramble up, to use up every last bit of rope. For metric-unit-challenged Americans, 60m = approximately 200ft, so if you are 90ft up, your 60m rope wouldn’t be long enough to do the trick.   In terms of a stick clip that you can carry up a route, This is the most compact one currently available. I still wouldn’t want to climb with it on a regular basis, it’s not a “just in case, might as well have if hanging on my harness”, but if you are trying a long route with a known crux higher than 1/3rd of your rope length, you have already tried to do the moves, and hadn’t been able to do them on your own power, this might be worth it to you.

Important to note that when you are stick clipping your way up a route, be very confident in the quality of the bolts you are going direct into. Ideally, you are just pulling enough slack to clip up to the next bolt but if the bolt were to fail while you have a full stick of slack pulled out, the ground could get close quickly.

Alex, just to be clear, the reason I know how to bring up the clip is because I regularly climb with some strong people who climb 5.13+ and I’ve seen them use that technique many many times when they just can’t get the crux that day. They’ll stick clip through to the next bolt and work out the moves without the big fall. It’s totally normal and fine form.

I was just saying I don't get why on earth you would want to skip, in my opinion, the best part of climbing. The mental aspect! But I should have known better. It's 2023 and everyone gets offended over everything. So sorry sport climbers! I get it. Ya want big muscles and hard grades! I must be crazy for wanting an adventure while climbing! Ps I never once said to the OP he was climbing incorrectly. Only to the guy who says he's aiding in Yosemite with a stick clip. I don't give a shit what you do or what you climb. However Yosemite becoming soft is something I'm seeing more and more every year but how dare I have an opinion about that! Must make me an elitist! Instead of being upset that I don't agree with you. Yall could have just told me why on earth you climb like that, as I originally asked? How is this a form of climbing!! Which I still do not understand. To project? Just don't get it. Anyways, On that note. Signing off this forum for good!

On the off chance you read this: I was joking about aiding with a stick clip. Though there is some truth behind it...Also: The reason for people dogpiling on you is because any argument about the mental aspect or purity of ascent in sport climbing is kind of silly. The whole point of the 'sport' is to eliminate as much danger as possible so you can focus on the athleticism.I apologize for starting the hate train on you, but I do hope you read and consider the above.

Climbing about pushing your limits and  I wanna do that without having to leave gear. And this makes you an elitist because you think your better then others because you don’t need to leave gear or half to stick clip to bail!

Now that my 10 year old is climbing way harder than me (but still mostly on TR for now), I've had a chance to employ these sport-aid shenanigans on more than one occasion to put a rope up on something he wants to try. If I'm putting up a route from the bottom, I'll generally stick-clip as high as possible from the ground then climb what I can or yard up the rope, go direct to the bolt and then have someone on the ground hand me the still extended pole.  I'll then just stick-clip bolt to bolt from there with the pole hanging off the back of my harness when I'm not using it.  If it's a route I'm climbing but can't finish, I'll go direct to the highest bolt I can climb to, and then lower a loop of rope down to the ground and have the pole attached to that loop with a carabiner and just have my belayer pull all that slack in which brings the pole up to me.  I'll then stick-clip to the next bolt.  If I'm still going to try the moves, I'll have my belayer lower me two bolts down and hang the clip there to lower the chances that I'll hit it if I take a fall.  Hanging on a bolt of an adjacent route is also an option, but sometimes too much of a pain to deal with.   Make sure if you are using a painter's pole type set-up that you check that the end where you would attach any carabiner or loop of cord or whatever is solidly attached.  They are usually just shoved on, so adding some glue or tape to secure is necessary.

 If you are very safety conscious you can attach a prussik to the rope and have your belayer keep you on belay as they’re feeding you slack. That will take a lot longer but will keep you from decking if the bolt failed on you. So prussik is on the leader's harness? Would it work to substitute a Grigri, with the climber strand to the bolt and the brake strand to pull up the stick? Seems like it would be easier to feed than a prussik...probably I'm missing something though.

You’d want the prussik (or Grigri) attached to the leaders harness tie in point (not your leg loop) and to the rope right below the bolt you’re in direct to. As your pulling rope up to get enough length to lower to the ground for the stick clip, you’re creating a loop of rope that if the bolt you’re in direct on failed you’d probably hit the ground. To eliminate that possibility the prussik (or grigri) keeps attached to the end of the rope coming from your belayer so if the bolt fails you’ll only fall the distance to the last bolt you clipped instead of the entire length of rope you just pulled up. Most people don’t do this step as it’s cumbersome but it’s the safe way to do it.

The basic mechanics have been explained in the first answer.Obviously you can only do this if you are no higher than ~1/3rd of your rope length up. If your rope is 60m, you can’t be any higher than ~20-22m up, depending on the steepness of the route, and whether there are any boulders your partner can scramble up, to use up every last bit of rope. For metric-unit-challenged Americans, 60m = approximately 200ft, so if you are 90ft up, your 60m rope wouldn’t be long enough to do the trick.  if you untie you could do it from a height of half your rope length, which covers almost all sport climbs.

I'm not usually Mr. Safetypants, but if the single bolt that you're in direct on failed while your "belayer" was tying the stick clip to the rope (quotes because he/she isn't really belaying you at this point), you'd deck. Personally, I try to avoid having to rely on a single bolt to keep me off of the ground.

Personally, I try to avoid having to rely on a single bolt to keep me off of the ground.And if a single bolt you fell on would fail, you would be in ground fall territory for at least half of the route. You never ever take falls before bolt 5 or so? Yes, you are relying on single bolt. But if you were willing to take a fall on that bolt, without worrying that the bolt would pull out, then it is highly unlikely to pull out when you are simply  hanging on it. Check that bolt before starting the process, for extra peace of mind. If it’s in good condition, not wiggling, etc, when you first go in-direct, you can hang a truck on it  As others mentioned, you can use a prussic for an additional layer of safety. I don’t know anyone who actually does.

Personally, I try to avoid having to rely on a single bolt to keep me off of the ground.If I have repeatedly whipped on a bolt, and want to stick clip up, I am 100% comfortable going into one bolt, lowering a bight, and hauling a stick clip up. Bolts don’t just fall out of routes, most sport accidents happen from rope behind the leg, worn permas cutting the rope, poorly bolted climbs causing injuries, or just belayer/climber mistakes or miscommunication. Fixed hardware if you visually inspect it and test it is safe.

Eh, a nonzero number of people having died from hardware failure. A rotten bolt might not look outwardly bad at all. I once tested a buttonhead that looked reasonably good and shiny. The head popped off almost immediately with an outward pull. If I had only tested it straight down, I might have trusted my life to it. There's plenty of other examples in the fixed gear forum of bad bolts. Though, I do agree that if you're repeatedly whipping on a bolt, that is pretty strong evidence that the bolt can hold relatively static bodyweight.

You can sometimes grab the rope from under the draw below you (not the one you are on) then tie an 8 and clip it to yourself to be into 2 bolts.

A follow up question for this thread.. What's your method for clipping up perma-draws?  Do you use the method of pushing a bite of rope through the stick and then pulling it onto the perma, or do you put your own draw on and then yard up and switch the draws out?  Heading to Smith this weekend and my before-mentioned, way-stronger-than-me son has expressed some interest in trying harder routes, some of which definitely have permas on them, and this is a sport-aid style I've not tackled, yet.

I would only hang my own draw on the same bolt as the permadraw if I am not trusting the permadraw for some reason, or I would clip my draw to permadraw if the gate configuration is such that I can’t easily clip the rope directly to the permadraw. Why add an extra step of swapping draw clipped to the permadraw, you don’t have to? Most stick clips these days work quite well for clipping the rope to the already-hanging draw, but it is a skill many people don’t learn until relatively-later in their climbing progression, because, until you start projecting, or climbing harder overhanging routes, you usually don’t run into scenario where you have to clip the rope to the draw that is already hanging. From my observations, it seems that most people first learn to stick clip the 1st bolt in a traditional way, with a quick draw attached to the stick clip, and the rope hanging off of it. Only later do they come across the scenario where they need to be able to remove the draw from the bolt (again, overhanging routes), or to clip a rope to the draw that is already hanging. East solution, of course, is to practice all of the above.

However, on principle as a dad now, I try not to rely on just one bolt. Forget about a prusik, there's a quick and simple method I use to connect myself to two bolts requiring only a single quickdraw, so I can go off belay to haul up a stick.-When you fall or take at your high point, lower to the previous bolt.-Take one carabiner off your quickdraw and put it on your belay loop. Now connect the free end of the dogbone to the quickdraw on the bolt in front of you (same way that you would extend a draw). Clip this extended draw to your belay loop so you're in direct. *this step is unnecessary if the bolt you're on already has an extended draw but it gives you extra space to work with.-Finally, take the belayers side of the rope and tie a clove hitch to the free biner on your belay loop. This creates a closed loop of rope connecting to the bolt above you. You can now safely go off-belay and lower rope down to get a stick clipThis sounds involved but takes almost no time and gives peace of mind when you're off belay. I wouldn't blame anyone for hanging out on a single bolt, just know the very small risk you're taking.

I wouldn't blame anyone for hanging out on a single bolt, just know the very small risk you're taking.I understand this method, and use it SOMETIMES. The issue with hanging on the bolt 1 below the top bolt that you had fallen on is that you now need a longer stick clip that would have to span a bit more than 2 bolts worth of distance, since you are hanging a couple of feet below the 2nd-to-last bolt. Sometimes it’s possible. Sometimes not, whether due to the distance between bolts, or a rock feature, such as roof, bulge, etc. I try to minimize the time I’m hanging on a single bolt, by tying an on-the-bight knot, and clipping it up my belay loop, as soon as I finish lowering the loop of rope to the ground. With that knot tied, I’m back on belay, and the loop of rope with the stick clip that I’m hauling off is a separate closed system from my knot to belay device.  Additional benefit of this system is that there is less rope weight to fight against, while stick clipping up. Once the next bolt is stick slipped, I usually don’t bother lowering the stick clip all the way down. I usually clip it to the bolt in hanging in-direct on, then until the in-the-night knot and ask the belayer to take in the extra slack. So there are two brief periods when I’m basically not on belay, because of the extra rope in the system, rather than the entire time I’m doing this. All of these tricks are good, but the more steps you introduce into the process, the more likely you are to create another problem by crossing/twisting the ropes, getting tangled, etc.

^to clarify, after I get the stick clip I would go back on belay, pull myself up to the highest bolt, then clip up. I think you misunderstood. And you're right to point out that in the act of stick-clipping itself and introducing 20+ feet of slack in the system, you are essentially committing to one bolt despite being on belay. That I am okay with.

Looking for help to send Gorka (my son) to enjoy sport/rock climbing with you.   I contact all of you looking for help and I would like to explain you my interest to send my son to USA or CANADA for some time to discover by himself new culture, shearing experiences with other people abroad, learning English and growing up as a climber. I think USA or CANADA will offer him a great opportunity.  I contact you from Bilbao and industrial city sited in the North of Spain, were the practice of rock climbing it´s very popular, my son 16th years old enjoys this sport training 3 / 4 days a week with enough experience inside and outside practice.   We contact you as climbers with full acknowledge so it will be easier for you to understand that I would like to send my son to practice / training rock climbing with experience people and learn some English (just sharing experiences with other people abroad, making good friends keeping a nice relationship).   Gorka as lot of climbers enjoy practice of some sports, rock climb, mountain bike, surf or climb the mountains. We are living in and area in the north of Spain were most people use to go to climb mountains.   Born on May 14Th, 1997 - 15/16 years old). Today’s graduation, 7a, 7b, 7b+ (5.12a, 5.12b, 5.12c) improving. Due to the fact the he is an sport young boy, participating in official competitions in our local Area and in Spain   Gorka does not speak English beyond the grammatical he could learn on the school, he works hard to get good results and enjoys climbing a lot.   My wife and I we consider that if we could find a place for him to stay in for 2/3 months in summer (July/August) climbing with other boys with no effort he will learn English meantime he improve climbing skills.   This is not a standard proposal but at least, as a father I would like to try the best.   Do you think it could be possible to find something similar for him?  Probably the best possibility would be to find a family of climbers with a boy of similar age or even older, it´s too difficult.   Thank you very much for you interest and good help.   As you are in contact with other climbers in your area may be you could recommend me something.   I do not know whether you could help us but please, in case you could, do not hesitate to contact me   Thank you for your good help  Best Regards  Felipe Ruiz Ruiz  +34 629445075  Italic Text

Amazing how quickly a thread can devolve.What I want to know is people's clever solutions for doing multiple single-strand raps with a pull-cord. My original method to re-set the rap at each anchor involved a lot of annoying safety knots to prevent dropping the cord or rope, but I think I've figured out a more efficient way.

I use the top half for layers, food, and water. On the descent, I keep the tagline stacked in the pack. I wear it while rappelling and it feeds itself feed out of the pack on the way down. That keeps it from misbehaving in the wind and on rock features. When we finish each rap, it gets restacked in the pack as it’s being pulled down.Another thing we bring is a microtrax that has two functions. First, on the ascent, the leader can tag the pull cord and use the trax to haul the pack. With this method, neither climber needs to wear a pack while climbing and all of the extra gear gets hauled each pitch. The downfall is that the tagline is swinging in the breeze and needs to be closely managed to prevent snags. The other function of the microtrax is as a rope grab when pulling the tagline after each rappel; that and/or wearing gloves will save the skin on your hands.

A 6mm cord will also sever far easier than 8mm+ kern mantle. I'd be shitting bricks if there were any points of abrasion.As I said in the other thread before it devolved into melodramatic hyperbole about bungie jumping rappels... The time  taken to tie an alpine butterfly is made up for by  not  having to extend your atc or fiddle with a  friction hitch. Fewer  knots, less equipment, fewer steps. Shrug.That said I think the OP of that thread was overly sensitive and wrong to say a biner block should be used in all cases Christian you also contradicted yourself.... Are you using an atc or gigajul... Two wildly different things

OK, here is an important point that might help people trying this technique.  Let's say you want to try to rappel with a tag line and a biner block, so you go to the internet to read a little about it, and you enter into Google something like, "How to rappel with a tag line."Many of the images that you find, including in reputable sources, will show something like the picture below.  This is one of the first images I found, but there were others, including from real rappels.  I think these pictures are missleading, and potentially dangerous.This set up can cause huge problems.  DONT DO THIS!  When you weight the main line, the knot joining the ropes can get pulled through the rings, basically locking your ropes between the joining knot and the blocking knot (ask me how I learned this). The issue is not that the ropes will pull free, but the ropes will get stuck.  I think a better way is to tie the blocking knot "above" the knot joining the ropes, or closer to the rings.  In this way, the joining knot can not get pulled through the rings.  And, of course, the size and shape of the blocking knot is important.  In my experience, an overhand on a bite, as shown in the picture, can get partially sucked through the rings, again making rope recovery difficult.  I like an alpine butterfly or a clove hitch, although another thread highlighted the potential rope-wearing problems with the clove hitch.Anyway, I hope that helps people who want to try this technique.  It can be really nice, but it comes with its own issues.

Long and short, if you're carrying a 6mm cord, why not just rap on it and avoid the issues that come with biner blocking?I've had situations rappeling with a Reverso on a main line and a 6 mm line where the 6 mm line was running through the device MUCH faster than the thicker rope.  Scary faster.  I immediatley stopped and switched to a biner block.  Like so much else, it's probably highly dependent on specific ropes, conditions, friction, and so forth.  This was on an ice climbing, with a thin triple rated single rope, and a Petzl Pure line.  Your experience must be more positive with this set up.

Also, I generally like to bring a single gri gri and nothing else when I go rock climbing. One locker, one gri gri, rack, draws. A simple system is an effective system, and you can also take a nap while belaying every once in a while.

Mostly do biner blocks when im alone and realize i forgot my ATC.  The past 2 have hosed me pretty good.  I try not to clip the cloved biner to the other strand anymore since i find it nice to be able to flick each strand independently throughout the pull.My rappel game recently leveled up when i purchased a super skinny half rope.  Really fast double rope raps since u can rap on either side (no untying joining knot and minimal rope movement).  Plus having another dynamic line is nice for peace of mind when rapping large faces.  A bit heavier than dedicated tag of course but likely marginal.  Nothing new here just wanted to share my setup and what works for me and contribute in a positive way.  Stay safe!

When threading the rap, what does your set up look like when using a 9.x lead line and 6 mil static pull cord? I do like stacking the 6 mil line in a pack to help mind it. I suppose I could still do that with your method, but it would need to be hung lower than my belay loop as opposed to being worn on my back, which would be less comfortable. But I’m open to learning new techniques. I’m curious what your rope connection/threading looks like.In terms of Grigris, I generally don’t carry a one on multi-pitch routes. I prefer to bring my second up with a tube-style device in “guide” mode (I use a WC Pro Guide Lite), as there are fewer failure modes. If I do carry a Grigri, it’s usually one per team, and left with the person belaying the leader.

I'm impressed. 100's of raps on my APER and it's barely showing wear, including past many roofs/bulges.Christian you also contradicted yourself.... Are you using an atc or gigajul... Two wildly different things  Have you used the Gigajul? It has two modes. ATC mode and an assist (not autolock except on certain - typically larger - rope diameters) mode. So yes, the gigajul can do two things, that's why i think it's a great device. Just don't use it on anything larger than 10.0, 10.5 MAX. I honestly don't know if you could squash a 10.8-11.0 rope into it, so it does have it's limitations, but I think it's the cats meow.Bruno wrote:  where the 6 mm line was running through the device MUCH faster than the thicker rope.  Scary faster...Bruno, that's why I went to the double biner method, I know it's arguably a hassle to bring up a second biner just for that but... I found I could use an anchor biner for it, so it works for me without much waste. fwiw, I'm running the GigaJul with the bulletproof triple FG, and then using the hms slidelock for the second biner, makes a WORLD of difference. That and a rap glove, you should be good to go. Also I try to only run it on atc mode, as the assist mode is kinda pointless when one side is only 6mm.Marc wrote: When threading the rap, what does your set up look like when using a 9.x lead line and 6 mil static pull cord?

I also do an overhand on a bight to the end and clip it to my harness, almost every time, so that I don't have to pull back up 50ft of rope in order to start threading before my second arrives.

EDK. I personally do a double EDK (one about 10" from tails, another, opposing direction, about 16" from tails), but not necessary, a single is fine.Edit: Ricky, thanks for posting that, didn't know. I've been told it's actually more dicey to do the double (more risk of snagging) but I put them close enough that it seems to work fine. Also, I can use the closed loop created by the double to clip it to a biner on the anchor to make my rap a fixed rap. This speeds up my rap and once both lines are completely hung, it def makes it a lot easier for the second to rap smoothly, especially if they're using double biner in their rap device.

Been doing this for a while now. I've found a clove onto a biner as a block works well... any other knot gets sucked into the rappel ring before being blocked by the biner. Tails are shortened for the photo, I'd usually leave more after the stopper. Works great with any rope pairing but especially for thin diameters where knots are not bulky enough to get stopped by the ring. Obviously this particular setup with these ropes is used only in certain situations. The rappel line is a petzl purline, with a edelred mago 8 (usually have to rig it in max friction mode), and a third hand prusik loop I spliced out of 1/8" technora as the sterling hollowblock doesn't grab at all on purline. The tagline is 2mm dyneema - don't bug me for not tapering the bury ;)Rope choice asides I'm interested what people have to say regarding the clove block. I've never had any issues with the clove slipping, but it is on my radar that it could, especially with such a slippery rope.

 ...and the setup to start rapping is much faster.I agree with this. I also agree that for every single subsequent rappel, it's arguably no faster, perhaps even slower. you have to pull the cord, overhand on a bight the main line to the anchor (so as not to lose it), undo the connection to the biner, thread through, reconnect it to the biner, and now you're at the same place you would have been at if you simply threaded the pull cord in the first place. Also, I generally like to bring a single gri gri and nothing else when I go rock climbing. One locker, one gri gri, rack, draws. A simple system is an effective system...  still need a pull cord, and the diff between a 5 and 6mm cord isn't much, for me... so I'd rather just have the semi-static 6mm and actually rap on it. but, that's just me and ymmv

The sequence starts from when you're pulling the previous rap and the joining locker approaches your rap station and ends with the next rap set up and ready to go. You pull a bight through the chains, fix to a new locker, and clip the pull cord to it before removing the previous blocking locker. You're left with a long tail that you can thread through the chains next time instead of the bight.As you can see it avoids the risk of dropping either rope or pull cord, as long as you can get a bight of rope through the chains. Doesn't take more than a few seconds once you've got the hang of it and it made our raps incredibly efficient - the person who does this switcharoo can be on rap and descending almost before the other is done pulling the rope.

I'm not particularly worried about it snagging as it's under tension and closed up the whole time you're pulling it, but that's probably something to improve on..

It creeps on the Opera (8.5) and Argon (8.8), holds fairly well on 9.5, absolutely doesn't hold at all on 7.3mm in assist mode, so my reasonable assumption is that it doesn't hold one bit on 6.0mm. IMO, it runs almost as nice as a Pivot in atc mode, which is the mode one must use when mating a 6.0 to a lead line.

I don't consider the tibloc/micro free-falling from the anchor to the ground not attached to the rope as "working," which is why I'm wondering if I'm missing something.

If the tibloc got caught on something on the pull, it could allow the rope to move through it, but on a free hanging or steep route, it’s fine. the knot is the safer option if there’s any concern for that, but I haven’t had issues if the rope is free on the pull

Bill Cosby was funny as shit, even when he was doing his "Spanish Fly" date rape drug bit. I hear R. Kelly wrote some really sexy songs, but he was also keeping women captive and abusing them in horrible ways. I also believe in letting the justice system work its course. But given that bail is a thing and this person is likely to be released at some point pending trial, I think it's important that other potential victims have a heads up about the very serious allegations the US DOJ has made against their potential new camping or climbing buddy.

There are plenty of folks in this community with additional information that informs their judgement. And, as someone else noted, it's really rare for sexual assaults to even be charged.

This is so crazy! I haven't seen Charlie in almost 15 years, back when Joshua Tree had free camping, so at that time, I imagine he could have been a very different person, but he was quite young, in his early 20s, and not exactly what I would call mature. He and the rest of the boys (and a couple of the girls I can specifically remember) were constantly engaging in what might be called "locker room talk", puns, and innuendo. Everyone was constantly soloing in costumes and it was far too common to see the boys wearing their girl friends hot pants, bikinis, or nothing at all! There was even a recurring caveman/woman? costume consisting of a mini skirt, tube top, and a large club that always ended hanging between the legs while they climbed. Lots of grunting, monkey sounds, and jokes that would be considered offensive by today's standards. But honestly, those sounds and jokes were constant, costumes or not, from the entire crew.. We saw far more of those guys than was necessary, seemed like someone was always sitting in gum even though we could never figure out who was chewing it, but I can't remember it causing anything beyond laughs and smiles. one thing I do remember, wether we wore costumes or not, Charlie was ALWAYS carrying a giant club with him, and as a result, no matter how crude the jokes got, we usually found him cute and funny and easy to be friends. He was a goofy type, he could be rude or crass, but I never saw him as mean. But a lot of years have passed since those days and everything could change, I just hope it isn't true. At this point, it's a classic case of she said, he said, and all the details are coming from the she said. There are so many strange details that don't connect the way intuition would suggest. My only thought on how it would happen 2 days in a row would be if they were on a wall together, which seems unlikely in August, but I bet one of his friends could figure that out. Also odd the accusations DEescalate in nature. Normally someone would test the waters first and if he gets away with that, try something more daring next. Someone mentioned a rape kit earlier, though I have NOT seen any official mention of one. If such was collected, then the incident would have to have been reported immediately. Why did DA wait 6 years to file complaint? It just doesn't make any sense! I do hope it's some big "misunderstanding" but domestic abuse is one of those charges where no matter what the circumstances are, if she says he took advantage of her without consent, he goes to jail, no questions asked, and is guilty until proven innocent. If he did force himself upon her, he deserves to be locked up and rot in there. Either way, Karma and God always know the truth and will even the score. For the next month or two, we just wait. The whole thing is just very sad.

Looks like the climbing “community” learned exactly nothing from the “Me Too” movement. Downplaying accusers, excuses based on unrelated behavior, gas lighting, reticence from fear of vindiction, we got it all here folks.Truth of the matter is that sometimes friends do bad things and charges wouldn’t be brought if there wasn’t a strong sense of a conviction. He’s toast.

The whole thing is just very sad.That’s awesome that he was cute and cuddly. There are a multitude of reasons why he would be charged with SA over 2 days- mainly the SA started at 11:00pm and the victim was then forced into anal and digital vaginal penetration again at 12:30 am. Karma and god do nothing, but the legal process will take much more than a month or two. People can draw this stuff out years. All we can really hope is that his other victims come forward (they are there.)

Reports and often subsequent convictions of well known and respected people for all sorts of crimes make me very caution of who I put on a pedestal especially if I do not know them very very well.  I can respect a persons accomplishments but not a person's character. Sociopaths are often likeable and charismatic people.  Often it is hard to identify a sociopath until after you have been deeply hurt, especially with your first encounter with sociopath and you are willing to trust what you see on the surface is the real person.  Because sociopaths are likeable and charismatic others in your peer group often do not believe what the sociopath did.  Often sociopaths are just playing with you for their own entertainment and feel nothing for you and sometimes the pain they cause is the entertainment.Like many I will wait and see how this particular case turns out but in the mean time I will have nothing to do with him, not that I know him or would have anything to do with him in any case.

Maybe that is the case for some, but, if so, that totally undercuts the fundamental concept of a just society. It means that based upon an accusation and possibly 'gossip' an individual can be permanently condemned even if it turns out that the accusation is not true or. at least, not supported by sufficient creditable evidence. Yes, a verdict of 'not guilty' does not definitively mean that a person did not commit the crime, but that is the best out imperfect system can do (and no such system yet designed by humans is 'perfect') and to then to consider that even despite such a verdict the accused was actually guilty really makes our legal system meaningless. In any circumstances,having had such an accusation made against someone will haunt them, at least to some extent, for the rest of their lives, whatever the outcome in court, and in our current age of instant and widespread communication via social media and elsewhere, such a 'taint' spreads even further, especially within a relatively small and connected community such as ours, than it it did in the past.I also, from very direct and long-term professional experience, disagree with your statement that "it's really rare for sexual assaults to even be charged.

In some jurisdictions DAs don't want to face the possible 'backlash' of not going forward on such complaints. Again, from my own experience, I have been involved in multiple cases that, once all the evidence was heard, were quite clearly false accusations and numerous others where there was sufficient doubt to result in acquittals (as well as others where my clients were convicted), so this type of 'virtual lynching' is something that I find to be very disturbing.

FWIW, I worked very closely with a rape treatment center for several years and I've seen the incredible reluctance of law enforcement to arrest rapists and for prosecutors to bring them to trial. Not saying this means Charles Barrett is guilty by virtue of being arrested but, simply, that in my experience prosecutors don't rush into these things carelessly or without credible evidence that makes them think they're going to win. Thanks for the clarification

I've never given it any thought until now, but 3/3 seems to make a strong case one way or the other. I will say you're wrong about one thing, alcohol is the problem. And I say that never having a problem with it myself, I don't get the appeal personally. Surely you wouldn't claim the same about opium, heroin, etc. The drug is the evil, and some just give in to it more than others. It's one drug that no matter how little or much you partake in, it steals a little of your soul. If you can't have an absolutely pleasant and enjoyable time without it or even without thinking of it, then it already has a piece of you.

Data gleaned from exhaustive studies helps to see what's actually happening a majority of the time and allows us to see what can be done that actually might affect a majority of those affected. The primary data source on the Rainn.org site, that's been linked already on this thread and supports the ridiculously low reporting to charging rates, use is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is an annual study conducted by the Justice Department interviewing tens of thousands of Americans each year"but it is far from always the case" is just another way of saying the "there are outlier instances" and the whole point of studies done with large data sets is to filter out the outlier instances to give an actionable picture. Because, after all, often the entire goal of pointing out the outlier is to prevent action upon the general case supported by the majority of the data, which is a weird place to put one's self imo.

You dealt with a drug addict, not a sociopath. As someone who lost both of his parents because of drug addiction, and also gone to therapy for the better part of 10 years; I can confidently say that drugs will totally change someone into something that is unrecognizable. Alcohol is also a drug and causes a lot of good people to do bad things.

The foreshadowing happened 2/3 and I dismissed it. And in general, I'm not saying I'm right, just sharing some hypotheses from my experience being around ASPD types and also all the other alcoholics I know. Alcohol, and other drugs, destabilize moods, and even more so in people that are already unstable. And yes, some monsters need nothing to do harm, those exist too.I also believe we're just peeling back the curtain on ASPD. It's becoming much more apparent how widespread this disorder is. Seems like more than ever, thanks to social media platforms designed specifically to spray as hard as possible, people are proudly narcissistic. The level of narcissism in the world is growing in direct correlation to how many IG/TicTok videos get posted.

 He was certainly a drug addict but the lack of caring or remorse also indicates a sociopath.  I came to the sociopath conclusions after watching him for a long time and understanding the his charming personality was used to enable his actions along with the absolute absence of caring or remorse towards his victims. Addiction and sociopathy are not mutually exclusive.    This is such a can of worms statement. First off, the American justice system encourages lying to get a better sentence. Secondly, is that you would not be in the same room as him for psychology sessions to watch him gleefully lie to a therapist to get what he wants. That isn't how therapy sessions work. I've gone to them for over ten years. It sounds like you watched him avoid punishment. My dads done it dozens of times. He had the option of like 15 years in prison for making meth, for go to rehab and do 18 months. He took the rehab and dudes already in jail again for drugs lol. From my experience, the only people I see doing unremorseful actions are addicts(another can of worms, since drugs are not the only addiction). The russian school mass shooting was done by people who were doped up in order to lower their levels of caring for the kids they took hostage.I've watched everyone, especially three year old's, use charming personality in order to get what they want. You watch too many psych tv shows.Things like sociopathy, ADHD, or any psychological disorder have levels to them. It isn't black and white. Nearly everyone has a degree of sociopathy to their personality, some have it to a probematic degree, but not many

Innocent Until Proven Guilty is the burden of proof for a jury to convict someone in a criminal trial. It regulates the ability of government to punish someone for alleged (until proven) crimes. It's not the burden of proof to have a conversation about someone or to hold an opinion about something they did. Do you get so upset every time there's a conversation about someone being arrested for an (alleged) crime like a murder, a bank robbery, etc.? Or only rape?

It is worth noting that the feds really like their plea deals and most cases don't go to trial.Data published by the Pew Research Center in 2019 highlighted how federal prosecutors have a 99.6% conviction rate. To put those numbers in perspective, U.S. Attorneys filed 79,704 cases in 2018. Of those, only 320 resulted in acquittals.

Let me be clear. I don't know if Charlie Barrett is going to be convicted of this particular crime he has been accused of.

That's what "innocent until proven guilty is about.On the other hand, the public is NOT a jury or a court. We're talking about something happening in our community. Remember when that sponsored climber, Joe Kinder, chopped down that tree in Lake Tahoe? And then he later went on to body shame Sasha DiGiulian? Remember how he was subject to judgement on MP and other communities of climbers even though neither of those things was a crime or involved him being prosecuted in court? Yet he faced shame and condemnation for his (shitty) actions? He lost sponsors and ultimately even engaged in some self reflection? See, I think that's good. That's a community holding its own members accountable. I happen to know someone who was assaulted by CB and later threatened by him for speaking up to law enforcement about what happened. So I don't actually need to wait to see what a jury decides to know how I feel about him. I think the community has a right to hold someone accountable either way.Back to the jury trial. I'm going to bet dollars to donuts that CB takes a plea deal when his lawyers get a good look at what he's up against. Just my hunch, nothing more, but I'm willing to make this a marker.I think that what you say about the friend and the accusation would hold more weight if you were using your real name here. I personally believe you but to a friend of CB you are just some anonymous person on the internet.Keeping this case in the light may help other victims come forward.

this is a weird one for me. tons of people on SM have come out openly with "its about time," multiple negative stories regarding his character on SM, and i know a fair number of people that are (were?) friends. never met him. i cant comment on that.i also get that these trials come down to he said/she saids and since the burden of proof is so high, that although found to be innocent, they are guilty. and no i cant say which ones and also i don't know how many. i do know less than 3% of the cases of sexual assaults end up with jail time.so if Alan Rubin, if you're still here what do you think about lowering the burden of proof in sexual assault cases? i personally would vote for it. haven't women been treated badly by our society long enough? shouldn't the pendulum swing a little in the opposite direction?im ok with the court of public opinion finding him guilty since the sentence from that court is what? ostracized by the climbing community? difficulty finding a job? a girlfriend? im ok with that.who thought brian laundrie was innocent?

Todd, absolutely not. As I posted earlier, I represented individuals who were subjected to what were eventually shown to be false allegations of sexual assault. Convictions of such offenses, at least here, often carry severe consequences. So, no lesser burden of proof for any crimes. No higher burden for former Presidents either.Didn’t you read what was posted a short time ago about the Central Park 5?

I’ll probably be blocked for too many posts today, but I’ll try, though am not that thrilled to be prolonging this non-climbing discussion.I believe that RAINN statistic is basically worthless, particularly in the context of a critique of the criminal justice system. It depends too much on assumptions regarding numbers of unreported sexual assaults. I am not disputing that there are such unreported assaults, many of them, ( and they are unreported for many different reasons), but it is unreasonable to criticize a system for not punishing perpetrators of such unreported assaults. I also know that there are assaults that are reported and, again for various reasons, not prosecuted, but it is hard to make any determinations about such situations without knowing the crucial details.But, I can report from my own personal experiences of having  been a criminal defense attorney for 50 years ( and I know that, as was said earlier in this thread, personal experiences are ‘only’ anecdotal but that is what I know to be true) that at least in the jurisdictions where I have practiced, most criminal charges, including those of sexual assault, result in guilty pleas or convictions. For those convicted of sexual assaults, particularly any involving violence or child victims, the sentences are most often very severe, including lengthy state prison sentences followed by long probation periods. Other than murders, the longest sentences my clients have received are for sexual assaults. Additionally, here in MA, and in most other states as well, even after prison, those convicted of such assaults have to register as sex offenders, often for the remainder of their lives. The most serious offenders also face the prospect of potential lifetime commitment to special prison hospitals for ‘sex offender treatment’ even after they complete their prison sentences.Given such very real knowledge, I can’t agree that those who are prosecuted and convicted of sexual assaults always, or even frequently , get off lightly.

Kelly wrote some really sexy songs, but he was also keeping women captive and abusing them in horrible ways.I also believe in letting the justice system work its course. But given that bail is a thing and this person is likely to be released at some point pending trial, I think it's important that other potential victims have a heads up about the very serious allegations the US DOJ has made against their potential new camping or climbing buddy. But he did a lot for THE CLIMBING COMMUNITY!Which means nothing, in the literal sense and in the context of this issue.

 If he’s found innocent, would you let your daughter climb with him?Nobody is found innocent.  It’s “not guilty” beyond a reasonable doubt.  big but subtle difference.  One thing missing in all the “justice”, “courts” , opinion, gossip, conviction vs acquittal, etc talk is that it is still all statistical guesstimating based on available evidence (some evidence is better than others).   Beyond reasonable doubt being generally equated to >85-90% probability of guilt (on avg based on judge polling).   Basically meaning that even after the courts tender a verdict, we still don’t “know” what really happened  So, even if not “convicted”, it’s hardly enough certainty for me to say “that’s good enough for my daughter to climb with him”.  Fuck no.OJ was “not guilty”.  Would you let your daughter date him?   Was he really “not guilty” ?As stated with the other statistics, there are a lot of women who know  with 100% percent certainty, and yet the guy is walking free.  Maybe playing football and regarded as a star somewhere.The only certainty is that it’s a shitty situation all around no matter how you cut it

Some really sad facts: Fact : 6 individuals were witness to CB sneaking up on his ex girlfriend and punching her in the head repeatedly in Bishop, California back in 2007ish. She fell with the first hit and he kept hitting her in the head while she lay helpless on the ground. Fact:  They testified in court on her behalf. He was convicted of a felony and served jail time.Fact: CB has a criminal history. He has been convicted of multiple violent crimes. Served multiple sentences.Opinion: CB is a world class climber and a really nice guy... until he's not.Its pubic record, look it up

I wasn't "hiding" behind my MP handle but I take your point. As you can see, my handle was just a play on my real last name. For now, since we're having this conversation, I've changed from my handle.

And, as noted ad naseum, he should be given the presumption of innocence by those jurors as they consider the evidence being presented in court. Full stop.  I think what you're confused about above is that your #3 is NOT part of the legal process. It's part of the public response to news.The presumption of innocence in the courts has nothing to do with whether or not an online community of climbers should talk about an arrest of a well-known, sponsored climber for sexual assault in Yosemite. We don't need to wait to see what the jury decides before discussing this fact. People can totally disagree about the facts, too, and draw their own conclusions.Alan Rubin

The issue, as I have seen it unfold, is that police and prosecutors are often reluctant to pursue sex crime charges unless there are witnesses or incontrovertible forensic evidence. And that means a LOT of sexual crimes go unprosecuted. Also, as we've seen in this very thread, victim blaming and judging makes it scary for women to report. Dave Kosmal wrote:I'm impressed that it we made it five pages before someone invoked OJ.But maybe Kobe Bryant is a better comparison?It's curious that the examples cited have been the Central Park 5, OJ and Kobe. First thing I notice is that CB is white and the accused in ALL of the above were Black men. I also notice that two were huge celebrities. My own experience is that it's usually not helpful to draw conclusions about the "Justice system" by looking at how it treats extremely privileged folks like OJ and Kobe. I agree that the treatment of the Central Park 5 by the NYPD and the NYC Courts was appalling.  But I imagine that if men being framed for rape is such an epidemic we might not have to reach back to 1989 and NYC to find an example. Do you think CB is being subjected to a racist justice system that is biased against white guys who grew up in suburban California?

“I reckon this prior incident and more recent hostile behavior toward women who reported him and testified to the Grand Jury must have carried a lot of weight with the Federal Judge. It's unusual for a sexual assault defendant to be denied bail entirely like he was.”This is pretty much spot on. I’ve had some three years experience dealing with alleged sex offender defendants, and I have seen only two denied bond. Both fled after arraignment and their conditions of release were revoked. One actually fled the State three times before he was placed on a no-bond hold. The other fled to and had to be extradited from Nepal.

I’ll probably be blocked for too many posts today, but I’ll try, though am not that thrilled to be prolonging this non-climbing discussion.I believe that RAINN statistic is basically worthless, particularly in the context of a critique of the criminal justice system. It depends too much on assumptions regarding numbers of unreported sexual assaults.disagree with this point as there is a set number of sexual assaults that go unreported and they gave a very transparent estimate of that number and how they arrived at it. so "basically worthless" is overly critical and to me exhibits a bias against these victims to dismiss it in this way. I am not disputing that there are such unreported assaults, many of them, ( and they are unreported for many different reasons), but it is unreasonable to criticize a system for not punishing perpetrators of such unreported assaults.hard disagree here. is it not the system or at least part of the system contributing/leading or dare i say causing this under reporting? I also know that there are assaults that are reported and, again for various reasons, not prosecuted, but it is hard to make any determinations about such situations without knowing the crucial details.very true. he said/she said is hard without other physical evidence--a lot of which seems to be lost due to how traumatic the experience is.But, I can report from my own personal experiences of having  been a criminal defense attorney for 50 years ( and I know that, as was said earlier in this thread, personal experiences are ‘only’ anecdotal but that is what I know to be true)personal experience does not equal truth. admitting anecdotal then claiming it is truth is inherently flawed. that at least in the jurisdictions where I have practiced, most criminal charges, including those of sexual assault, result in guilty pleas or convictions. For those convicted of sexual assaults, particularly any involving violence or child victims, the sentences are most often very severe, including lengthy state prison sentences followed by long probation periods. Other than murders, the longest sentences my clients have received are for sexual assaults. Additionally, here in MA, and in most other states as well, even after prison, those convicted of such assaults have to register as sex offenders, often for the remainder of their lives. The most serious offenders also face the prospect of potential lifetime commitment to special prison hospitals for ‘sex offender treatment’ even after they complete their prison sentences.and? it appears that you think the punishment is too harsh?Given such very real knowledge, I can’t agree that those who are prosecuted and convicted of sexual assaults always, or even frequently , get off lightly.i think you are conflating "real knowledge" with experience again, but here i can agree. i think the 22 out of 300 and something that actually get convicted face imo justifiably harsh sentences.and please i am not trying to offend you, Alan. most of my points are just semantics. i am also admittedly intimidated by engaging someone of your profession on a topic you have far more experience in than me.i am a father of 2 young girls and i am emotional about this subject.the recent supreme court ruling on abortion/womens' rights really shook me. since my kids (both girls) were 5 or 6 they were taught by us that only they can decide what happens to their bodies before they really understood what that meant; which now at 10 and 12 they do understand what that means. it can make me sob that we felt like they needed to understand. recently i told my 12 year i was going to cut my hair because my wife doesn't like it and she got mad at me and said, "daddy, no, only you decide what happens to your body!" i cried. edit: the supreme court making me a liar to my own children really hurts.there is a problem with our system. something needs to happen. i don't know exactly what that is, but the conversation needs to happen.sincerely,Toddedit: thanks Alan and Andrew for using your real names.

Depending on your poll, Approximately 50% to 70% of those think that Trump actually won in 2020 and the election was fraudulent. So that's about 15%- 20% of the US population. Not great, for sure, but I'm not sure what it has to do with CB getting arrested for rape or the odds of a false conviction in Federal Court. Given the requirement that a jury rule unanimously that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt I find it hard to believe this defendant will be unfairly railroaded.

(Refer to graph below) This all really boils down to an epistemological debate.   At what percentage of “truth probability” are we allowed to discuss things or even make judgments in the “court of public opinion”?No easy or universal answer, but In terms of crimes, there are live victim crimes (someone knows exactly what happened -other than the perp) and strictly evidence based crimes -  we are left to interpret evidence to piece together what happened (nobody knows 100% what happened).In the case at hand we have a live victim with  a fairly close immediate community of family, friends, and acquaintances (climbers) who know both victim and accused with past data points to back up the credibility of the victim.   We here on MP (by proxy) are therefore well within the 50/50 probability gossip line by judging the credibility of people within the innermost cores of probability.  Just gonna go on a limb and say we are likely over the 70% threshold and therefore our consciences can can rest easy with slagging this known rat bastard regardless of what the legal system does or doesn’t do.  Save the “gossiping” reservations, concerns, and hand wringing for case B scenarios where we are just one of the totally clueless unwashed masses and don’t really know shit more than 50/50

@ Padawan YodaAre you kidding me?  You need this explained to you?How would I reform the judicial system to respect women to a higher degree, and therefore help punish male sexual predators, and prevent sexual assaults on woman?  Let’s start at the very top. How about ensuring that the highest court in the country, the supreme court, does not include two men, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, who were credibly accused of sexual assault, and one woman, Amy Comet Barret, who currently belongs too, lived with, and married within, a true cult, that believes in the absolute superiority of men, that women should subjugate themselves completely to men, surrender their financial, legal, emotional, and physical independence, and so on.  To extend a discussion of the supreme court to this thread, going back in time twenty or thirty years, would you let your daughter clerk for Clarence Thomas?  Would you let your daughter go to a frat party with Brett Kavanaugh?   Would you let Amy Comey Barret give your teenage daughter advice about dating, sex, love, and marriage?  No chance.  One way to ensure that the supreme court does not end up like this is to return to principles of separation between the branches of government, and put in place guardrails, or procedures, to insulate the selection of supreme court justices from partisan politics.  It’s a travesty that the legislative branch blocked the fair appointment of Merrick Garland.  In a functional democracy, that wouldn’t happen.  We need to focus on democratic processes. Moving down a rung or two (or three) to lower levels of the judicial system, how about ensuring that we just don’t have judges like the man who asked a woman who was raped why she didn’t just “close her legs” or the judge who allowed a young college student to walk free from a sexual assault conviction because he came from a good family and had a bright future?  https://www.mic.com/articles/137569/a-judge-just-slut-shamed-a-rape-victim-by-asking-her-why-she-didn-t-close-her-legshttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/us/brock-turner-blamed-drinking-and-promiscuity-in-sexual-assault-at-stanford.htmlTo be fair, both these judges were removed from office, but this way of thinking, the blatant victim shaming, blame shifting, and misogyny in the first case, and the boys-will-be-boys dismissal in the second, are endemic of deep-seated beliefs and practices woven into our society. In the same way that lower-level workers, such as police officers and teachers, are made to sit though hours of sensitivity training, perhaps all judges should be made to do the same?  Perhaps, as part of their training, they should be made to sit face-to-face with the families of victims of murder, for example, as well as with murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and simply talk to them about he course of their lives, how they got where they ended up, and so on.  In similar fashion, perhaps they should be made to sit face-to-face with, say, one hundred women who made claims of sexual assault that were dismissed, and listen carefully to the details of each case.  These women would not be hard to find.  Likewise, and just to be fair, they could sit down with an equal number of men who were false convicted of sexual assault and later exonerated…except that this would be difficult, because the incidence of such cases is vanishingly small, especially in comparison to the former, despite the strident voices on the internet that appear to claim the contrary. Essentially, as above, the education, training, and selection process for judges could be significantly improved, and perhaps for lawyers as well.  I would say that higher education (Masters, Phd) in social work or similar should be a pre-requisite for judges and layers in such fields, the same way that I believe judges in complex financial or medical cases have extensive education in these fields. What about at the local level, such as the Tiffany Thiele case above?Well, one thing that could happen would be that, when a violent sexual assault is reported, it immediately triggers a higher level state or federal response, so that the case is immediately handed off to teams with extensive experience and power to investigate such crimes, offer counseling and other forms of support, and so on.  It seems that there are some mechanisms like this in place, but they failed in the case above.  Making these procedures more widespread and robust would be a good start.  Essentially, we cannot leave it to small police departments, with limited funding, experience, and perspective, to investigate these very serious, complex cases.  Finally—and this is controversial—perhaps in a cases where the facts can’t be established, and it’s essentially her word against his, as it often is, then both parties would be required to enter a period somewhat like probation, for a year of two, with regular visits to authorities, mental health check-ups, some interviews with significant others and family members, and so on.  Essentially, if you, as an adult, entered a relationship with somebody, you would assume the risk of these consequences.  The knowledge of such consequences might reduce the incidence of sexual assault.   This would represent an invasion of privacy, a limitation of personal freedom, without proof of a crime, and this would be unfair, but this unfairness would be balanced against the larger (in my mind) benefits to society.  This would recognize the huge number of sexual assaults by men on women in society.  It would acknowledge the serious nature of the these crimes, the difficulty to find evidence for and prosecute them, and the fact that men so often escape punishment.  It would give less weight to the infringement on personal freedoms, and more weigh to the potential benefits to society to trying to redress these wrongs.  So that’s just a start.

@ Bb CcI don't understand your point exactly.  I was replying to Padawan above, who asked how the justice system could be improved.  In this case, it looks the criminal justice system is doing a good job.  The accused is in jail, with no bail, facing federal crimes, likely looking at a lengthy jail sentence.  We'll see how it plays out.

Bruno, I’m not going to fill up column space here by quoting your entire post. In response, though, it is hard to know where to begin, as you mix some very reasonable suggestions ( some of which are already in place, at least in some locales) with appallingly bad and scary ones. Let’s start where you did, with the Supreme Court. First, that Court has little involvement in sexual assault cases—I can’t recall the last time a decision from that Court dealt with such crimes. In general, such crimes are rarely prosecuted in Federal courts for jurisdictional reasons ( almost all are handled in State courts)—Mr. Barrett’s case is in US District Court only because it is alleged to have occurred in a national park.But, I presume that you are mentioning that Court because of its symbolic value and because of the present membership that includes a couple who have themselves been accused of sexual assault and others who support policies upholding male ( white male) power. I share your distaste for those individuals and their philosophies. Still, focusing only on the sexual assault accusations—they still remain just that—accusations, so my beliefs,stated earlier, about making decisions based only on unproven allegations holds as well for them. Remember there are many people in this country who believe accusations that the Clintons had former aide Vince Forster murdered or that the Democrats run a sex trafficking cabal out of a pizza shop in DC. A functional system needs boundaries, and one that lets unproven allegations be the deciding factor in making such important decisions would be much worse than the ( still far from from perfect) one we currently have. Of course, issues of sexism ( and racism and…) in our legal system go back very much further and are rooted much more deeply than ‘explained’ by the current make up of the Supreme Court.I really can’t address every point you make, but can say that your suggestions about more ‘sensitivity training’ at all levels of the justice system are reasonable ( though not necessarily the specifics you suggest) and are in fact being implemented in many places. There are also many locales that do have special units, with significant resources, focused on investigating and prosecuting sexual assaults ( I work in one such jurisdiction). There are also, in many states, legal provisions that permit prosecutors to introduce types of evidence in sexual assault cases that they cannot use for other types of offenses, as well as cross examination limitations on defense counsel in such types of cases. False accusations of such crimes, though rare, are not quite as “vanishingly” so as you believe.It is your final suggestion though that is most disturbing ( an understatement), so clearly so that it doesn’t require a detailed rebuttal. Not only is it wrong in very fundamental ways, but, if put in place, would likely be counterproductive to what you are hoping to achieve. Do you really believe that a system that would punish the accuser as well as the alleged perpetrator in ‘close call’ cases, would encourage more victims to come forward? The opposite result would be much more likely.Now I’m going climbing.

The one thing that I would add to this discussion is that people who are convicted of violent sexual assault should be sentenced as severely as murderers. Seems to me that too many are released after a short sentence and do it again. Convicted date-rape predators should also face harsher sentences. Some are actually released without any jail time because they come from "good families."

No parole in federal convictions btw. Now, the judge does generally have discretion to suspend a sentence or run convictions concurrently, but even then the defendant faces a long exposure and lifetime public registration. Where we do see instances similar to your point is if a defendant pleas to a lesser charge, or the jury “splits the baby” and convicts the defendant of a “lesser included charge.”

‘Innocent until proven guilty’ is not the same as ‘on the balance of probabilities’. People need to remember that. While the criminal justice system uses to former to protect an accused’s liberty interests from the immense power of the state, people should avoid using it to shield men from credible accusations of sexual assault. If the victims were to go after their abusers in civil court, the burden of proof would be far lower. We, as lay public, ought to bear that in mind when we’re evaluating cases like this one.

Alan, I'm interested in your opinion on this:  In my mind, a big problem with the justice system is that courtroom attorneys are mainly judged on whether they win their cases - regardless of whether or not justice is actually served.   It seems like that would create a conflict on interest in many cases, including whether to pursue rape and sexual assault unless it is a slam dunk, as someone said earlier.  Not to mention incentive to railroad defendants who are poor (can't afford a good attorney) and minorities and others who fit stereotypes that make them less sympathetic to a jury. We've seen extreme cases of this where there was outright misconduct by prosecutors that put innocent people in jail for decades.  But my knowledge of these things is very shallow - nor do I know of a good solution, except for harsher penalties for prosecutors and police when they break the rules.  What do you think?

Good question Cocoapuffs, and I’m going to have to answer with a ‘punt’—-it depends. There are ‘bad’ prosecutors, defense attorneys, cops, judges, etc. There are some totally corrupt systems around. Then there is racism, sexism, and other biases, both conscious and unconscious, that pervade the legal system (all systems actually). But still, from my experience I believe that most involved are sincerely trying to do the right thing and ‘play by the rules’. Yes, winning a trial is nice, but at least most whom I’ve encountered have not been trying to do so at any price.Actually trials are quite rare, most cases are resolved through guilty pleas, alternative dispositions or, occasionally, dismissals as a result of further investigation. Despite what was once believed, this is, in most circumstances, not the result of poor lawyering. One factor is the result of inherent constraints in the system—trying all or even most cases would cause the system to be almost immediately overwhelmed. But more important is the simple fact that in most cases the evidence against the accused is very clear and so strong that taking the case to trial would be very unlikely to result in an acquittal and could very likely lead to a stiffer sentence.I think that overall in many parts of the country the legal system has been improving ( in trying to achieve truly just results) for quite a few years—look at the exonerations of those wrongly convicted that have been occurring. I am very concerned that with the present political climate in certain parts of the country, as well as the current makeup of the Supreme Court, that we are about to see a reverse of this progress.

I once had a client who the USG wanted to get on a white collar financial crime. But to encourage him to plead to the white collar crime they threw the book at him with "interstate drug trafficking" charges for flying between SoCal and Las Vegas on his private jet while partying really hard with his friends. They literally said, "Either you plead to this white collar crime OR we throw the book at you and face 20 years in Federal prison."Unfortunately for the Feds, this guy was a billionaire with giant balls and a lot of resources. He spent millions on lawyers but in the end prevailed.I can easily see how a less affluent person accused of drug trafficking and facing decades in prison might plead to a lesser charge and accept a few years in jail, just to avoid rolling the dice.But in the case of sexual crimes like rape, I don't think there's a similar issue. Sex crimes are very hard to prove and rely mostly on witness and victim testimony vs. hard evidence. So very hard use that to railroad someone.

I’m going to go ahead and cancel him, he can have his day in court, he can deal with the legal consequences of whatever comes of this, but his legal history has been documented on here and the individuals who have reported harassment by him of a sexual nature have really demonstrated that Charlie is neither a steward of climbing nor is he inclusive; rather he is a predator.

While, yes, there have been cases of false accusations, they are statistically at a much much smaller percentage than the percentage of certainty needed for reasonable doubt conviction. 3.  Generalizations are fine for generalized circumstances.  This is a SPECIFIC circumstance with specific evidence.   We are well beyond the application of generalizations here.  4.

Stalin didn’t just send people to the gulags,He signed thousands of pages of lists of people to be executed. Stalin is a great example of why we want our best of breed justice system. Not perfect but not corrupted like Stalin and his thugs.A fair trial is a genuine gift.

There are many individuals that have interacted with this Charles and been sexually harassed by him, when they came forward Charlie’s friends harassed them into silence.So not only do we have pro climbers saying "finally" on their social media but we've got other people that enabled him still in our community and no one will do a thing? Between this and what I've experienced in the climbing community I'm not sure we'll do anything but continue to play catch up and feign outrage.

Hell on earth.Hurt people hurt people, which may help explain the genesis of the behavior, but it doesn't ever exonerate someone from their own behavior. One has to stop denying that their own behavior is unhealthy. There are 12 step/anonymous (and alts!) for those who have had a traumatic, abusive, neglected (etc) filled childhood. It takes a lot to break out of generational trauma, but it's so worth it from the day you take your first steps out of it. PSA and all. It's real hard to convince someone you know to explore this track unless they've hit bottom.

Yup, trauma and a rough upbringing may provide context but you can’t let the hurt child in you make grown up decisions. There are many avenues for people to get help and we are responsible for our actions. Thanks to folks in this thread to adding to this discussion, I’ve learned a lot and shining a light on these actions (and the reactions to them) are vital to a healthy community, bring Justice to perpetrators and closure / healing to victims.

There are so many stories about that one role model or that one teacher that helped somebody turn their life around.I don't want to deny that some people just need a little nudge, but this could also be far from the case, as one of the strategies to survive a traumatic childhood is by isolating oneself from others (how do you trust and feel safe towards anyone if those that were supposed to protect you as a child, abused you?) and taking on a severely overwhelming sense of responsibility over others (as you may have become the caretaker of an adult - even to the one that abused you), rather than taking care of one's own needs first (which you were taught were not important in comparison).A best friend, a long term partner - none of these people can be enough, if one is sick enough. Sometimes it does take hitting bottom, going to jail, having absolutely no where else to turn to but inward towards your own hurt and pain, accepting that you are sick, then seeking help. I'm actually quite amazed that this isn't something that comes up more often in the climbing world, as living a detached life of constant travel and seeking out excitement is one real great way to live a "comfortable" (familiarly chaotic, dramatic, and exciting) life, if all you've ever known is a chaotic upbringing where nothing was for certain safe. Not to say climbing is always a sick coping mechanism (that's absolutely ridiculous), but like alcohol/drugs/sex additions it sure can be.

The Jon Krakauer and justanotherpaleguy exchange cut-and-pasted below:justanotherpaleoguyThis guy may be guilty of what he’s been accused of, or he may be innocent… Thats what a criminal trial is in existence to establish. I appreciate this post is well intentioned but it reduces the chances of a fair trial. I think that could allow Mr Barrett to argue he didn’t have a fair trial, appeal a guilty decision (if it goes that way) and get off. Best to leave the Police-work to the Police. And please bear in mind he might actually be innocent. In which case think of the damage you’ve just done… krakauernotwriting@justanotherpaleoguy In no way does this reduce the chances that Barrett will get a fair trial. The “police” (actually the U.S. Department of justice) sent out a press release asking the public to help them with their investigation of this case by providing them with tips about other sexual assaults Barrett may have committed. One of Barrett’s victims then asked me to share this request on Instagram. If Barrett had been arrested for a different type of crime, I doubt you would have posted this. Because rape is probably the only crime in which the victim is assumed to be lying. You should be much more concerned about the victim getting a fair trial, not Barrett. Rapists almost always escape accountability. justanotherpaleoguy@krakauernotwriting please dont make assumptions about my intentions. I clearly acknowledged your good intentions but felt your post to be a bad move, and still do. Stating “if Barrett had been arrested for a different type of crime I doubt you’d have posted etc” is a deliberate attempt to make me look bad to others reading this. So to be clear, I would have done exactly the same for any alleged crime. Innocent until proven guilty regardless of the offence. justanotherpaleoguy@krakauernotwriting also notice how you’ve escalated the offence from sexual assault to rape. This is why I advise caution, they are not the same. Again, to be clear, I’m not making excuses for the accused but when it comes to criminal law accuracy of language is important. I also notice you didn’t acknowledge in your reply that it is possible he is innocent… krakauernotwriting@justanotherpaleoguy You're right. I should have written that sexual assault (which includes rape) is probably the only crime in which the victim is assumed to be lying. Regarding Barrett's innocence, I didn't acknowledge that he is innocent because based on what I know to be true, I am convinced he sexually assauted multiple women. In the U.S., the presumption of innocence is not a specifically enumerated constitutional right; it is a doctrine embodied in the right to a fair trial. Only during the trial itself is a defendant entitled to to the presumption of innocence. Many laypersons (like you, apparently) do not understand this. Nothing requires me to state what I believe to be untrue. The criminal justice system is designed to achieve procedural justice, not actual justice. It often fails to convict culpable defendants because the system relies (correctly, in my opinion) on William Blackstone's famous pronouncement, "the law holds it better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent party suffer." Unfortunately, when it comes to the crime of sexual assault, the criminal justice system allows thousands of guilty persons to escape for every innocent person that is convicted, largely because of ubiquitous myth that women lie about being sexually assaulted, when in reality, peer reviewed research shows that only between 2% and 8% of sexual-assault allegations are false. So yes, you should worry less about Barrett getting a fair trial than the women he has victimized getting a fair trial. justanotherpaleoguy@akgal80 please explain, and I truly mean explain, not just cast aspersions. To me, both yours and Jons comments perfectly illustrates why the US is in such a mess at the moment. Rather than read my comments and be generous in your interpretation of my intentions you jump to a polarised position, assuming I’m some type of victim shaming ignoramous. Just because my opinion doesn’t align with yours neither makes it tone deaf, or incorrect. justanotherpaleoguy@krakauernotwriting you’ve mixed fact, opinion and research there. I take no issue with the facts (peer reviewed studies more so but lets not go there). Could you evidence your statement that “ the criminal justice system is designed to acheive procedural justice, not actual justice”? And for info I worry about the victims getting a fair trial as much as I do about the accused. If you re-read my initial post, and apply a little generosity in your interpretation of it, I think you can see that… krakauernotwriting@justanotherpaleoguy The criminal justice system prohibits the prosecution from presenting incriminating evidence at trial if it was obtained by violating the defendant's 4th amendment rights--as it absolutely should, because it's more important to protect constitutional rights than to convict those guilty of crimes. That's just one of many examples of how procedural justice is more important than actual justice. I don't see your original post expressing anything about a concern for the victims getting a fair trial. As I reread it, all I see is you accusing me of doing damage to Barrett in the event that he didn't commit the crimes he has been charged with. justanotherpaleoguy@krakauernotwriting I think interpreting the prohibition of using illegally obtained evidence as proof of procedural justice over actual justice is a leap. I can see we’re not progressing this conversation to bring our opinions any closer though. However I want to be entirely clear before I bow out. So I’ll reiterate, I believe the initial post to be well intentioned but a mistake. And if you cant see, from my initial post, that my interest is in a fair trial, then you aren’t being genuinely generous in your interpretation, ie the reason I pointed out that the accused might claim an unfair trial is because I didn’t want it be an option. I want a fair trial for the victims as much as the accused, with actual (not procedural) justice. I believe this is best achieved by an impartial judge and jury. As you claim to know something to be true relating to these events, you clearly are not impartial, which probably explains your reaction to my post. I’ll leave it there. krakauernotwriting@justanotherpaleoguy You are right again: I am not impartial. I spent 4 years researching and writing a book about sexual assault titled “Missoula: Rape and the justice system in a college town.” If you truly care about obtaining real justice for survivors of sexual assault, I urge you to read it. From writing this book I learned how horrifically prevalent sexual assault is, and has always been. I also learned how seldom survivors of sexual assault receive justice, and how misinformed most of the public is about these matters. Because you wrote that my original post was “well intentioned but a mistake,” and seem to believe that “a fair trial for the victims as much as the accused, with actual justice (not procedural) justice” is a likely outcome in a criminal justice system designed to ensure that the latter prevails over the former, I think you are as ignorant about the realities of sexual assault as most of the rest of the public in both the US and the UK. Which would explain why your default reaction to my original post was to be concerned about the perpetrator rather than his victim(s).

I have thought about this post for a few days and I guess I feel like now is a good time. Defense of the accused I believe to be a deep seeded implicit bias in most men. I think standing on some false moral high-ground of innocent until proven guilty in this setting more often with sexual assualts versus other crimes is a clear example of this. Thanks to Jon Kraukauer for trying. I hope @justanotherpaleoguy can introspect just a little.I think this is sub-conscience (hence implicit, duh!) and most men are unwilling to delve into this part of who they are/may be. I am not perfect when it comes to the topic of implicit bias. I didn't challenge anyone when it came to sexist jokes for a large portion of my life. Or worse I think about times when I was a still a moldable high schooler and a classmate or friend even  would say something like, "I would totally fuck that," as a female classmate would walk by. By not challenging that, with a "dude, that is no way to talk about someone!" Could that have prevented that person from going on to sexually assault someone? I believe so.  I believe all of us need to look inward and make some changes and work toward zero tolerance of all sexism.

As previously stated our justice system is slanted heavily against the victims of sexual assault rather than the perpetrators, hopefully the prosecution does it’s due diligence and is able to present the most accurate case possible.

 Alan, regardless of whether I agree with you (honestly not sure where I stand right now) I have appreciated the perspective you have brought to this discussion.  I suspect others do as well, but of course they are not the most vocal.Just to clarify,  I 100% appreciate Alan’s perspective, in general I am 95% aligned with him, It’s just in this specific case, I seem 180 degrees opposed.    Edit to Padawan:  that is a good question and point.    I don’t have a clear answer to that.  I do think there is definitely room for redemption/changing in most  of the “criminal spectrum”.   Especially for crimes like burglary, drugs, etc.  Likely gets a bit hazy towards the violent or sexual end of the spectrum, for example  like child molestation.   That seems (at least to my current understanding) more due to being “fundamentally fucked in the head”  to use the scientific term, and much more difficult to just change a perspective or attitude.

 But in sexual assault cases, on avg, the statistical probability of guilt out of the gate (~92-98%) based on the peer reviewed research, already exceeds the avg “certainty” a jury uses for reasonable doubt.Maybe I'm making a mistake checking people's math on a Humanities & Social Sciences thread, but I think you've got this backwards.  The phrase "already exceeds" seems to imply that it is ideal for these 2 numbers to be the same - or at least that the relationship between their ideal values is positive.  I'm pretty sure it is in fact negative.  In a hypothetical world where 100% of the accused sent to trial are in fact guilty, you'd want the jury's guilt probability threshold to be 0 - any higher value needlessly lets guilty people go free with no benefit.(not disagreeing with your larger point, but your mathematical justification makes no sense)

Ask 100  random People (potential jurors) what “Beyond a reasonable doubt”  means and you’re likely to get at least 70 different answers.    A Duke university survey of judges (a more select group of people who should know) estimated a percentage of certainty equivalent to reasonable doubt to being anywhere from 70-95% certain the fucker was guilty.  Kind of alarming in its own right if some judges are thinking it’s OK to sentence 3 out of 10 innocent people to prison as the price of doing business but I digress.   Let’s just assume the random sample of avg Joes and Janes is something in line with judges and centers on about 85% certainty on avg for a guilty verdict across crimes, cases,  and juries (in general).Therefore my math.   That as we sit here in this thread, given the totality of info presented, we are likely >95% certain that Charlie is a Shitbird of the highest order, and that is already better odds than the avg legal process results (~85% certain). So, especially since this isn’t actually a court, there is no need to equivocate.  We can sit on our high horse with confidence.  Of course we could be wrong.  And Bigfoot might exist.

I agree with your conclusion, it just makes no sense to compare the 2 numbers as if it mattered which one is bigger.  What we actually care about (from the side of protecting those falsely accused) is something akin to (not exactly) the product of the 2 numbers hitting a certain target - that determines the system's overall (prosecutors + juries) effectiveness at protecting the innocent.  In other words, the higher your first number (95% in your example), the lower the acceptable minimum for second number.  That's what I came here to say.I would have just said "the percentage of innocent people among those sent to trial is lower than you might think, therefore the jury's role in making sure the innocent are acquitted is smaller than you might think".

It's the violence part that makes it criminal, after all (unless it's a statutory thing), not the "sexual" thing. [Although there's still a heckuva lot of prejudice in that regard, on a lot of fronts, sadly. Another discussion]That violence is a hard thing to solve. All of us know those who are, or have been, in that "fucked in the head" category, short term or long. Perhaps even ourselves at times. I know people who frankly state that "jail saved my life". So yeah, I'd like to hold out hope of redemption for people.But it's so unlikely for some.It's quite possible to acknowledge that possibility, even consider it a given that it is possible....while understanding it is still unlikely.As one who was that "classic" rape (stranger with a knife at my throat) at age 19, it had a lot more complexity to it than just "bad guy did bad thing". There was a lot more to think about than just "victim", both at the time, and as time went by.Now?I am profoundly grateful, by sheer blind luck of the draw, that I very luckily happen to have lived the life I have, happen to be the person I am, with the cards I've been dealt. A doable life.And am also aware that somewhere out there?Someone else has had a very different life.I know what it's like to be me.I can't even imagine what it must be like to be him, how he got started, what his life was like. WTF happened to this guy?????We don't get to choose most of this. This isn't a male/female thing, for the broader arguments. Substitute all sorts of shit besides sexual assault, and it still comes down to the same things.I would have had zero qualms about killing him, in the moment, or if something happened now, for that matter. But I simply don't want to live my life prepared to do so. I would nonetheless want any accused to have their day in court, with good representation, and a fair trial according to our laws. Burden of proof. Even if I was sitting in the witness booth.And I'd give fair judgement as a juror, then and now.Better yet?Work on that "fucked in the head" thing, fix this before it ever happens.I'm not holding my breath on that one.Best, Helen

You and others have decried THIS discussion as a "lynch mob" and other derogatory terms. As if it's wrong to have a public and community discussion about the subject of a high-level climber and guidebook author being accused of and prosecuted for sexual assault in Yosemite, which is basically the temple of American rock climbing. That's just patent bullshit to call it a "lynch mob" or all the other terms you used for it.As others have already noted, it is very striking to me how this issue of the importance of not giving one's opinions MOSTLY seems to come up around rape and sexual assault.  None of the many current newspaper reports about Jeff German's murder, (allegedly) by the politician he was investigating, seem to have provoked this response of not discussing the case publicly. There was no outcry by the public of,  "Ronald Greer and Bianca Stanch are innocent until proven guilty", when 4 yr old Samiah was killed by torture in Adelanto.  We've received hundreds of details in the press of the fraudulent doings of lawyer Tom Girardi, and no one is confusing that reporting with the trial(s) he will eventually have. Andrew has done the climbing community a benefit by starting this thread, enabling reporting of facts, and facilitating this discussion.

I agree, Phylp. It wasn't that long ago when the Gabby Petito's murder dominated the news. I went back to check the thread and there was the same speculation and defense of "poor Brian" on Mountain Project as most places (though it was somewhat better here).  This does not mean that we have to convict the accused before a trial but nobody here is sitting on the jury to do that (as far as I know).  And while I have tremendous respect for Alan and the work he is doing it is clear that the system is failing victims. It should be acknowledged that it has failed some of the accused as well by dragging their names through the mud (the CBC guy seems like a real shithead whereas the Duke lacrosse stuff was actually made up) these instances are overwhelmingly in the minority (and thus why they become famous).The sad reality is that even when things go to court, not guilty does not mean innocent, and justice is very hard to come by in these situations.I'd say ask Gabby, but, you know.

Many incarcerated people come in with multiple offenses. You’d need to break down the list even further to get an accurate picture. Most “drug charges” have assault, weapons, various degrees of attempted murder, trafficking, gang activity and/or domestic violence attached to them. Those lists tend to just file them under “drug related”. True drug only charges are short term and usually don’t go to actual prison, unless they’re trafficking large amounts. Those (small drug offenses) make up a large percentage incarcerated in Jails, but not prisons. Jail terms are typically less than 1 year.

The part about Waters’s friends encouraging her to report what happened, and the repercussion she faced when she did, hit especially hard.I think a lot of survivors of sexual assault have had experiences where they were encouraged to report and it ended up being a negative experience (fortunately not always on the level of what this article describes). It’s hard because it’s natural to want to encourage people we care about to seek justice when they have been harmed. And we definitely don’t need more messaging discouraging people from reporting sexual violence. At the same time, I think it’s important not to pressure people to report and to understand that they may have very valid concerns about the outcomes they can expect.Sending good thoughts to any of Charlie Barrett’s victims who may be making this difficult decision now.

I feel like these things don't happen in a vacuum.  It is true that a little help and compassion will go a long way for certain people in certain situations. But when dealing with the type that actively harm others, a little enabling will go even farther. A lot farther.Not only are harmful people aware that others will overlook certain things and give them a pass because of empathy, systemic social norms, friendship, charisma, reputation and/or whatever else, they are counting on it.Like most people here, I most definitely want to see justice done in this situation. More than that it's making me question some things about the climbing community in general - what is enabled, what is tolerated, when do people get a pass for bad behavior and so on. Like most of us if we are honest, I have close friends, coworkers, family who have been victims. I want to know just what the line is, because that is how safe things are, full stop. I am certain that the line is not zero tolerance (personally that's where I draw it). My main interaction with climbers has been when climbing. I am and will remain well out of any climbing social scene or climbing subculture.

These do not happen in a vacuum.  Real world situations lead up to it.  The perpetrator is already enabled.  Afterwards, how and why do you think all the social pressure   happens that prevents it from being reported and justice served?  To be honest, I get quite angry when I think about what happens with the entire cycle, not just the act.Anyway if found guilty I hope they throw the book at him.

Some really sad facts: Fact : 6 individuals were witness to CB sneaking up on his ex girlfriend and punching her in the head repeatedly in Bishop, California back in 2007ish. She fell with the first hit and he kept hitting her in the head while she lay helpless on the ground. Fact:  They testified in court on her behalf. He was convicted of a felony and served jail time.Fact: CB has a criminal history. He has been convicted of multiple violent crimes. Served multiple sentences.Opinion: CB is a world class climber and a really nice guy... until he's not.Its pubic record, look it up Note* While the previous submission is entirely true . I was advised to edit this submission & to delete any of my personal information.What did the 6 individuals do in the moment who witnessed this? Did they intervene? Stop it? Just watch? Give him a beat down? Anything?

During the ~6 months I worked at the gear exchange he would come in all the time, would chat about guidebook stuff, was very friendly to me when I was new in a town with few people who knew my name. Learning about his mental health issues in the article made me feel a connection as I struggle similarly with these things. Horrible to think what he was doing while I was sympathizing with what I can only imagine was a tip of an iceberg of extreme issues.You can even see in the responses the vague ways people discussed Charlie’s ‘antics’… he’s anxious, has baggage… well im anxious too, and what kind of baggage? Imagine if someone mentioned his assault in 2007 rather than the playful “stint in Taft.”Six years ago wasn’t that long, and I’m upset I didnt see the signs that are now pretty clear.as to why witnesses didn’t intervene, witnessing a violent assault isn’t something most of us are prepared to deal with, especially when it’s a huge aggressive violent person. They testified against him and helped send him to prison.

I concur That was my first thought, but since I wasn't there and don't know shite about this guy or any of this beyond what's on this thread, I was sincerely asking the logical (to me) question: 6 people watched that and.... ? Seemed like something was left out between witnessing the event and then showing up in court to testify. And since this thread has had a lot of discussion about other climbers enabling/glossing over actions, I thought it was a relevant question.Not saying that testifying was not brave, and not saying what I would have done, or someone else should have done either. One never knows how they'll respond in these situations, myself included, so not trying to be judgmental or imply anything.But I definitely wasn't saying that the assault was OK just because no one intervened or OK for any other reason. Moreover, I don't know that no one intervened, that's why I asked. Maybe Ezra knows and that's why he responded as he did.

Before a witness can testify at trial, they are interviewed by not just the prosecution, but also the defense. If not, defense can move to exclude the witness. Before it gets to that point, a witness to something such as an assault would also generally be interviewed by law enforcement for the report/complaint. Defense will parse the police statement, witness interview and subsequent testimony to find any inconsistent statements to attack the witness’ credibility. It is no small thing to be a witness in a felony prosecution.

I went back and read the beginning of this thread, and it seems like many of the arguments of the last few pages were brought up earlier. For that, I apologize for my role in it. One thing that was mentioned in the beginning that is interesting as an idea separate somewhat from the sexual assault accusation is this:Eastern Sierra Old Guy wrote:Charlie has his issues but has given much to the climbing community. We are all here presumably because we get a lot out of climbing. Who actually gives to the community? We all have a role it seems but it's always an exchange of sorts, too. Anyway, just something to think about I guess.

I’ve had the defense pull stunts such as requesting witness interviews on Christmas with hope that prosecution would be unable to set them up, thus providing reason to exclude the witness. It actually gave me great pleasure to make those interviews happen, and then have the defense attorney get all huffy because they had to attend an interview on Christmas day. I do believe that in California a victim of a sexual assault is shielded from being forced to provide a pre-trial witness interview. In most states that is not the case.

In what capacity?  To do it right and to do it safely is difficultThat depends on what "do it right" means, and if you mean subduing a large, violent person, in can be difficult but it doesn't have to be, and that's not a foregone conclusion., and you need a well trained and coordinated team. It's tough.  Debatable.  I too have had experience and ONE properly trained person can help someone else that *should be* properly trained but isn't.  In this video, this is demonstrated quite well.  Notice the size and strength of the cop, vs. the relative size and strength of the "suspect", then look at the size of the dude that is "assisting".  The large, busting out of his uniform (fat AND muscle) cop can't control someone who appears to be of similar size and greater strength.  One well-trained, much smaller guy changes this equation quickly and dramatically.  One guy is supposed to be trained, and isn't, and one of them is trained but doesn't operate in the typical state-sanctioned position of authority, i.e. police officer.  So, they're not a well-trained team, but still manage.  I've been in this scenario a few times, and I can certainly say two things- if no one is trained, then yeah, 6 people probably would botch this up, and get injured as a result of trying to stop someone in the commissioning of a crime/violent act against another person.  You don't need a squad of SEALs though, to subdue someone that is of average size

I don't wish "violation" victimhood on him and retributive justice doesn't really do anything except temporarily quell the feeling of bloodlust and justice that we all feel when someone close to us gets hurt (or just someone that's vulnerable- smaller/weaker, etc.).  It does no good in the long run.  However, this alleged piece of shit probably shouldn't be walking around in society if he's guilty of what he's being accused of and DEFINITELY not around climbing areas.  To the idea that 6 people should or could have done something- I used to be one of those people that would immediately scoff and think "cowards!!!".  I've come to realize after a ton of reading and years of research on the topic, that most human beings, believe it or not, have an extreme aversion to physical conflict and violence.  There are scores of accounts from eyewitnesses and from the "victims" (not quite an accurate term to describe willing military combatants) themselves that when it came down to it and it was hand to hand and bayonette time, they ultimately chose to be killed rather than kill.  It's a visceral instinct that's not easily overcome.  People that grew up rough, embedded in a subculture that promotes and encourages violence (honor culture is rife with this) jumping on someone to save someone else might not be that big of a thing, but to MOST people that grow up in more civilized parts of society, which is the case for most people that are climbers (just my experience) inserting oneself into an already violent altercation isn't something that can be readily expected.  Quick story, when I was a young father, and in WalMart (this is going on 20 years ago) I saw this guy yank on his pregnant gf/wife's hair and with pursed lips, yanked her head toward his as he screamed into her ear from about a half inch away.  I saw red and can barely remember grabbing the guy by his hoodie and slinging him into the vitamin aisle to the degree that the whole thing was knocked over causing a calamity of 1000 rattly bottles striking a tiled floor.  I freaked out once I realized what I'd done and ran out of the store hoping that the cops wouldn't be called on me and hoping that it didn't make things worse for this young lady.  The point is, I didn't think, I just reacted, and that was based almost entirely upon the environment I grew up in, bolstered by formal training I had received.  For people that didn't grow up like that-  in violent, dysfunctional atmospheres, and aren't trained to stay calm in situations that involve physical altercations, that instinct is the exact opposite.  They have an instinctual reaction as well, and it's to try to keep the peace and not escalate by abstaining from engaging in physical conflict.  It's very easy to say they *should* have done this or "I would have XYZ"- just saying that's very difficult to make that statement with any real meaning behind it.  The human psyche when it comes to violence varies wildly from person to person.  Sorry for the drift, just thought this was relevant to the direction the conversation has shifted.

Not to continue this drift further, but it IS apropos to these and any future situations related to this thread…mental training, prep, awareness, and commitment  is as much/more important than physical ability to intervene.  Anyone caught completely off guard and unprepared is more likely to react “deer in the headlights” in an unfamiliar and surprising circumstance Edit:  obviously typing mine as the above were being posted

Just want to highlight that people who have experienced trauma as a result of these events are very likely reading this thread (ditto any other thread about a traumatic event). Obviously thread drift is hard to avoid, and it can lead to worthwhile conversations. Still, I think it's worth taking a moment to try to put oneself in those people's shoes and think about how these comments might affect them. There's always the option to create a new thread for more abstract/general discussion about bystander intervention, how to reconcile cognitive dissonance when a bad person also has impressive accomplishments, rehabilitative vs restorative vs retributive justice, or whatever else.

Geez, guys, you sure enjoy making heaps of assumptions.The 6 witnesses?May have been 6 seperate people, some (or even all) not right there, just able to see whatever they reported.No one on here knows what any of those people didNo one on here knows diddly nor squat about those 6 people. Old, young, english speaking, riding by on a tour bus???If people see others are in closer proximity, we tend to assume those others know what's up and will do whatever. If you aren't trained to instant action, it takes a bit for stuff to register and try to sort out just what you are seeing, THEN figure out what, if anything, you personally can do. Some do better than others, that's not their fault nor responsibility (except when it specifically is their duty)Would I personally insert myself in the middle of fists flying? Hell no. That would be stupid. But that does not say anything derogatory about me, and, in fact, I have inserted myself into dangerous messes now and then. Largely precisely because I am a dinky female, totally unthreatening, and stand a pretty good chance of being able to talk people down. I can say things to people that a dude can't. Just being male, can escalate things. Pretty sure  guys understand that???Best, Helen

And that Charlie was "just being Charlie."Unfortunately, this is all too common. So often by the time these things get public attention, they've already been an open secret for a long time. The case against Harvard regarding sexual harassment and assault in the Anthropology department is a vivid example for me personally. I was a grad student there when this shit was happening, and many of my colleagues and I knew (with varying levels of detail) that the Comaroffs were not safe people for female students to be around. I studied with several of the professors who signed an open letter in support of the accused, and I know at least one of them had repeatedly gaslit students when the topic came up in advising meetings. (This same professor claimed they'd had no idea of the facts of the matter when the plaintiffs' lawsuit came out.) The lawsuit is ongoing; meanwhile, John Comaroff is back teaching at Harvard.To me that's what erodes trust in these "communities" the most. Not the fact that there are individual people who do awful things, but that there are so many people who give it a pass--including people you respected and trusted. It sends the message loud and clear that a hard FA or academic prestige is worth more than your safety. Pretty hard to want to belong to a community that holds those values.

Geez, guys, you sure enjoy making heaps of assumptions.The 6 witnesses?May have been 6 seperate people, some (or even all) not right there, just able to see whatever they reported.No one on here knows what any of those people didNo one on here knows diddly nor squat about those 6 people. Old, young, english speaking, riding by on a tour bus???If people see others are in closer proximity, we tend to assume those others know what's up and will do whatever. If you aren't trained to instant action, it takes a bit for stuff to register and try to sort out just what you are seeing, THEN figure out what, if anything, you personally can do. Some do better than others, that's not their fault nor responsibility (except when it specifically is their duty)Would I personally insert myself in the middle of fists flying? Hell no. That would be stupid. But that does not say anything derogatory about me, and, in fact, I have inserted myself into dangerous messes now and then. Largely precisely because I am a dinky female, totally unthreatening, and stand a pretty good chance of being able to talk people down. I can say things to people that a dude can't.

 Same. In what capacity?  That depends on what "do it right" means, and if you mean subduing a large, violent person, in can be difficult but it doesn't have to be, and that's not a foregone conclusion.Debatable.  I too have had experience and ONE properly trained person can help someone else that *should be* properly trained but isn't.  In this video, this is demonstrated quite well.  Notice the size and strength of the cop, vs. the relative size and strength of the "suspect", then look at the size of the dude that is "assisting".  The large, busting out of his uniform (fat AND muscle) cop can't control someone who appears to be of similar size and greater strength.  One well-trained, much smaller guy changes this equation quickly and dramatically.  One guy is supposed to be trained, and isn't, and one of them is trained but doesn't operate in the typical state-sanctioned position of authority, i.e. police officer.  So, they're not a well-trained team, but still manage.  I've been in this scenario a few times, and I can certainly say two things- if no one is trained, then yeah, 6 people probably would botch this up, and get injured as a result of trying to stop someone in the commissioning of a crime/violent act against another person.  You don't need a squad of SEALs though, to subdue someone that is of average sizeMission accomplished.

Sure, if I hear an MJ song on the radio, I tap my foot like the rest of us. I’m not saying Cosby wasn’t funny or whatever person wasn’t talented. But maybe there’s some sort of moral obligation to stop supporting them if they’re shitty people. I would feel uncomfortable buying CB’s guidebook if it would be supporting him financially in any way.

I've refrained for some time, but seems worth it to state this plainly at this point, mostly for the folks who are sorting through all this for the first time:You know a rapist personally. It is almost guaranteed. (If you know a rapist personally because you were assaulted or raped, I'm incredibly sorry.) Sexual assault is incredibly common, and is perpetrated dominantly by repeat offenders.However, these individuals are predatory. They put significant energy and effort into disguising their behaviors and intentions. They are good at gaslighting, darvo, flattery when needed, bro-ing down when effective, intimidation if required, and physical violence if all else fails. Depending on their preferences, skills, and access, they may put significant time and energy into grooming. They put energy and effort into reputation, precisely so that they can be protected by "he's such a good guy" narratives. They use victim blaming to their advantage by socially isolating victims and assuring them no one will believe them if they report (because they typically won't). Law enforcement reception to reports is mixed at the absolute best, and huge numbers of officers are themselves abusers at rates higher than the general populace. It's all pretty fucked up, but here we are.Some back of the napkin math, Fermi style:Depending on how its defined and who's doing the research, about 1 in 5 women in the U.S. is a sexual assault survivor and something like 1 in 30 for men, so let's just conservatively say 10% of the population (or 1 in 10; since women are approximately half the population) has been subjected to sexual assault of some kind in their life. If a serial offender rapes 10 people (a reasonable estimate), that should put us in the correct order of magnitude (and will be a conservative estimate). This would mean that about 1% of the population are rapists, or something like 2% of men. This follows (and is a smaller estimate than) the research, which puts the number typically somewhere in the mid to high single digits.If you believe the Dunabr number, which is a socio anthropological theory stating that you can maintain a max of about 150 stable interpersonal relationships, then you know a rapist personally, maybe a couple. This shit is SO COMMON I cannot stress it enough. Since reporting is so uncommon, information is passed informally via social networks (not necessarily social media, but old school person-to-person in various ways). In my experience men are often not privy to this, but I assure you that the folks with vulnerable identities of all kinds are on alert for this behavior.*I'm aware my math largely excludes women perpetrators and anyone who identifies as other than woman/man; just trying to make a point about how common this problem truly is. You'd need to have a very unusual (impossible?) social network to not have this problem in it. And since I've added this footnote, transgender individuals experience even higher rates of sexual violence.Edit: "never get a woman hammered in order to play" is the literal definition of rape. And just to be clear, if someone gets hammered for any reason and is raped, the rape is not their fault; it is the fault of the rapist.

The vocalist for as I lay dying went to prison for attempting to murder his ex-wife. He made strong efforts to make it clear he knows he majorly fucked up, and uses his platform to actively advocate against those actions.  He currently sells sold out shows for every venue that they play at. So yes, there is definitely room for redemption. Idk Charlie, but it doesn’t sound like he intends to be better, seeing as he has a repeated history of this stuff

Yet, according to the Tahoe Quarterly article posted up a bit, some of the most famous people in climbing seemed to have no trouble looking past all of that and trusting CB as their rope gun and belay partner. I think that's weird.Yes, the history indicates someone who makes poor choices. I do ad hoc background checks on potential partners, party pics on Fbook, long hair, rap sheets, just a “sketchy” look in general, I dump ‘em.

I have put off responding to this thread for a while. I'm a criminologist and I've also dealt with sexual violence. One of my areas of specialization is reentry from prison and I've worked with folks who have committed a range of offenses. I have some responses to different discussions on this thread.First, I think Locker meant exactly what he said. For a long time, rape and other forms of sexual assault have been understood as women's responsibility. Locker can go get stuffed. Second, regarding the discussion about people returning to communities, I have met some folks who have gone through terrible childhood trauma, and who have done terrible things. They have come to terms with their trauma and taken responsibility for their actions. They have made the decision to atone and are doing the work every day. The key words in the sentence are "doing the work." These people have decided to earn their way back into their communities. It is a commitment and a lifelong journey. People need support for that journey, but they have to decide to engage in it for themselves. Third, it is important that communities exercise informal social control. This is rooted in the relationships within the community. If someone is an asshat we don't climb with them, right? If members of the climbing community would refuse to put up with sexual and intimate partner violence and remove people who participate until they earn their way back by engaging in restorative practices (This is complicated and varies from place to place.), that would help.

I don't think Locker is saying "don't get drunk around a man you don't trust". Locker specifically says "Don't get fucked up with some dude you don't really give a shit about..." as if there is something inappropriate / mixed signals about a female getting drunk with a male "friend", as if they are entitled to misinterpret that.It's all very fucked up.

Interesting.  I have a daughter, and I will absolutely tell her to avoid get drunk around people she doesn't know, trust, or care about.  (If I had a son, I would definitely tell him that no means no, that consent needs to be implicit, and that if a girl/boy/partner is on drugs, consent can not be adequately provided.)When I say, "Try to avoid getting drunk around people you don't know or trust or care about," I am not suggesting that she would bear any particular blame in a case of sexual assualt, beyond the responsability we all should have for our own saftey in potentially dangerous situations.  Perhaps this the part of what makes this discussion of blame and responsability complicated. On one hand, women are consistently blamed and shamed in sexual assault cases. This is a terrrible aspect of such crimes, and a reflection of widespread underlying sexism and misogny. On the other hand, everybody bears some responsability for their own safety.  For example, if I went to a rough neighborhood, got drunk, and was robbed and beaten, I would bear some responsability engaging in dangerous behavior. A woman getting drunk around men should not be dangerous but it obviously is.  So what should we tell our daughters, sisters, and friends?

What some of these comments are missing is the fact that often people who commit rape and other forms of abuse are people the victim knows and trusts. It is a key part of intimate partner violence and coercive control. So, really loud for the people in the back row, saying don't drink with someone you don't trust is NOT FUCKING HELPFUL!!!

 Todd you absoluty damn well better tell your kids not to get drunk or high with people they don't 100% trust.  If you get shitfaced out in public and bad things happen to you you absolutly bear responsibility for what happened same as you would if you ran someone over with your car. this dosent take any responsibility for the crime off of the perp but its a burden the victim absolutly will have to live with.  drugs and alcohol are never an acceptable excuse for bad behavior and that includes passing out in public.  My bad dosent cut it when you cripple or kill someone because you have addiction  issues and it will also be something you will have to live with if you put yourself in a bad situation and get hurt because you were shitfaced.   i trashed my shoulder on a rope swing once  hammered on genny cream ale. My fault. if I pass out on a pool table and get sodomized with a pool cue that will also be my fault for putting myself in that situation.  The sick person who did the deed is absolutely 100% at fault but I also have to live with putting myself in that place and time  with no control over my situation.  Don't get so hung up on political correctness that you forget all sense of personal responsibility. drugs and alcohol suck. 2 people just OD'ed in a motel  1/2 mile from my local crag.

My point is that the argument works both ways, it shouldn’t, but it is things of this nature that allow rapists, murderers, etc off the hook (sort of).You can provide your own link for your original claim that drunkenness was successfully used to  give someone a temporary insanity defense in a murder trial.The legal system will accept that drunkenness doesn’t allow a person to give informed consent.  This is different than reducing or removing responsibility for an action.   The argument dose not ‘work both ways’.On a side note, diminished capacity isn’t ‘whatever I want to call it’. It’s a legal term that means a person wasn’t able to reach a mental state required to intend to participate in or commit an action.

@ Todd and Andrew, I appreciate what you have brought to this thread, and I hope we can keep this civil.  We're talking about what we think is best for our children, so of course emotions run high. I don't think it's fair to equate my advice to my daughter, "Don't drink around people you don't trust," to putting my arm around my daughter who has just been raped and saying, "Well, you shouldn't have worn that short skirt" (as per your example).  I think there are important differences between these statements, as I will try to explain below. @Deirdre, it sounds like you do great work.  It must be a little like being a public defender, but from a different angle?  I have been a high school teacher and counselor for over twenty years, and have had the clothing, drugs, sex, violence talk with countless teenage boys and girls, both before and after terrible things happened.  I think about it this way.  People in general, but especially young people, can and will do dangerous things, they will make mistakes, they will get lucky, they will get hurt, some of them won't survive, and some of them will make it through but never be the same again.  I put myself in the latter category. So, when I tell my daughter and my students (male and female) that they shouldn't get drunk or otherwise altered around people they don't trust in unfamilair circumstances, I am acknowledging the risks of the world, and trying to steer them through as safely as possible.Just as sexual assault is a reality, victim shaming and blaming is a reality.  So, once again, with my daiughter and my students, I rely on detailed, nuanced conversations, backed up with examples, and lots or questions, answers, and clarifications, to help them understand the difference between assuming the responsability to keep yourself safe--because it's a matter of survival--and working to build a society where people can wear whatever they want, do whatever they want, and not risk being assaulted.  I find that most young people understand and appreciate these differences instinctively.  They completely understand that I am not blaming them by telling them not to get drunk around people they don't trust; they recognize that I am just doing my best to keep them safe, which is my role as an educator, parent, and friend.  Yes, I think of my students as my friends. More generally, I think some of the voices on this thread are confusing the way they wish the word was with the way it actually is.  I would love it if my daughter and students could grow up in a world where they didn't have to worry about what they wear or what they drink when they go out to have fun, but we don't live in that world.  So we have to do what we can.  Having these conversations--like this exchange on this thread--is part of changing the world and making it a better place, so I reallu like the fact that people are expressing their vision of the world they wished they lived in.  But until we reach that goal, I will keep advising the young people I love to try to avoid dangerous situations as much as possible.  I beleive that anything less would be unrealistic and unresponsible.

Should your friend being drunk and vulnerable be brought up in trial to determine if the perpetuator is guilty of beating and robbing someone? I understand the general point you’re trying to make though, and I do appreciate your participation in this thread!As someone who has been assaulted twice in completely different circumstances, let me give some advice as one of the few women in this thread:1. Teach both your daughters and sons to mitigate risk surrounding drugs, alcohol, etc. I’ve heard people say in this thread that alcohol can turn men into sociopaths or make them more dangerous but people are only advocating teaching daughters to no get drunk around strange men. Also emphasize that no one is perfect and if they don’t make all the right choices and something happens, it’s never their fault. You want your close ones to trust you to not judge them and be able to reach out to you if something. No one is saying don’t teach people to use drugs responsibly, it’s just that if an assault happens, its not productive to bring that up on your own if a victim opens up to you. To expand on this:1. There are many ways to mitigate risk around drugs and alcohol. Avoiding certain types of settings is one way. So is establishing a trusted person that you can go to or call if something feels off. So is being willing to "make a scene" (something that women too often are taught not to do) if someone is behaving in a harmful way. So is learning techniques for bystander intervention. (This mitigates risk for the people around you, not for you personally--but the more people who learn and practice this, the safer everyone is.) 2. To repeat what Deirdre said earlier, perpetrators of sexual violence are very often people the victim knows and trusts. Sexual violence often occurs in situations that should be "safe." Teach kids that consent, once given, can always be withdrawn. Teach them that consenting to one thing does not mean a person consents to another thing. Teach them that all parties involved need to give enthusiastic consent. Teach them that coercion is never okay. Teach them ways to keep their friends safe and how to safely and effectively intervene if they're worried something unsafe is going on. Personally, I wish I'd gotten more messaging about this growing up and less about the dangers of dangerous strangers lurking in alleyways and at bars.

A drunk driver had the intent to get drunk and drive, not kill someone. However, if I get drunk and pissed off, and then I shoot and kill someone, I very much had the intent to kill that individual, regardless of my intoxicated state. See the difference?

 Derek DeBruin, you memorized progressive liberal propaganda well.However, most likely these numbers are significantly exaggerated.I found research of CrimperGirl on Supertopo more credible and she reported numbers significantly lower than yours.As for my experience I am not aware of anybody among my friends who has been raped or raped somebody.Do I socialize with wrong people?Sexual assault includes rape, but it is broader than that.Yury, perhaps you're only thinking of adults, here?We're pretty sure my husband, who died as a chronic alcoholic who started drinking at 12, was sexually molested/abused as a kid, perhaps by his grandmother.And just because you are not aware, doesn't mean it hasn't happened. I would also say that it may not be true that people who knew CB knew this was going on. People can be very very adept at fitting in. Most people aren't what you think they are, unless you are very close friends, and maybe not even then. My husband hid his problems very well....until it all came crashing down.To the parents on here?Definitely stay a safe person for your young person to talk to, about anything. Daughters or sons, need to learn to be cautious, unfortunately. I'd say, not just don't do stupid stuff if you aren't with someone you trust, as we all know stupid stuff will come up. It's a big ask, but instead, have someone around that you trust, for anything that might become a stupid stuff situation. And that means someone sober and able to assess and help. Or at least simply be an extra person there.For the rest of us, who may have young friends you know well?I gave my phone number to the neighbor kids as they got to be teens. It was a call me, any time, no matter what, I'll come grab you, no strings attached. Get out of the situation. None of them ever needed it, but they knew the offer was there, without the further difficulties of dealing with parents.The closest I came was riding to the hospital with a teen after a really stupid car wreck near my business. Very full load of teenagers, ostensibly getting a ride home after school (teen driver) and it somehow seemed a fun idea to run every single stop sign. Until it abruptly wasn't fun. Six kids taken to the hospital, minor to major injuries.Stupid happens. Like they say, good judgement comes from bad.But that does not get idiots/jerks/predators off the hook for their actions.Best, HelenEDIT to add, Anyone else see the parallels in picking climbing partners, in this last stretch of comments?We choose to do something inherently dangerous and potentially lethal, usually involving other people.There's a considerable amount of risk analysis, and a whole helluva lot of trust.

One time in my younger years I went to a club, watched my one drink, and was roofied regardless….. I was lucky that time but to say don’t get drunk around strangers or people you don’t trust is victim blaming. Also intimate partner violence and sexual coercion are both forms of sexual assault so I said what I said. Those types of comments are not helpful and contribute to the victim is responsible for being raped mindset. Yes teach your at risk children to protect themselves because it appears there is still a whole gaggle of people who think no means yes.

Some people are actually suggesting you shouldn't minimize risk? And if you point out how, you are "victim blaming"?  Minimizing your risk is not the same as letting the perp off the hook. I didn't realize this was such a difficult concept.  But it is.  (post limit)Edit: Petzl, I was speaking in general terms - not just alcohol and not just this case. But being drunk increases everyone's risk for any situation.

Given the context that we don't even know what role, if any, alcohol played in this case, how could the pleas to "minimize risk" around drinking be anything other than victim blaming?

My story was not about being drunk it was about being drugged which can happen anywhere at any time. Should women not date? Should they not have food or drinks on the first date? Should they climb with all their gear including water to avoid being drugged. Let’s play this all the way out- risk management is not teaching womxn to be afraid all the time it’s about teaching men to not rape. Blaming a womxn for being taken advantage of in any form is victim blaming. Risk management yes sure I love teaching any young adult about risk management, would I let my daughter go to a party with strangers? Yes,  if she’s drinking a coke or a tequila the risk for being drugged is the same. The risk for assault is similar.

  Not in any way trying to dimmish the conversation about how terrible of a problem sexual assault is. I am advocating everyone  regardless of gender to have good situational awareness.   date rape is likly one of the most common occurrences and I am not suer what you can do to prevent that because dudes are on their best behavior and trying not to show their faults when they are trying to get laid.  I do know that getting hammered won't help any situation.  getting hammered is maximizing risk..  Heck I don't care what gender you are it bothers me when folks wear ear buds in public. can't think of a better way to block your situational awareness.  Except maybe getting hammered and wearing ear buds.  Even pro athletes get run over by trucks training with ear buds. way back in the days of the sony walkman one of the Mahre brothers got mangled by a groomer skiing with headphones...   Situational awareness.  I pack up my camp every evening, park the van pointing out, everything is set and ready to roll. I know where the keys are and all I have to do is jump up front and drive..  Curtains and privacy glass are key.   about 6 years ago in the tetons , south of jackson at a fishing access parking lot there was a young lady sleeping in a subi in her underwear. it was hot so she had the back hatch and a side door open and no curtains or anything. broad daylight. empty beer cans etc..   I really hope that she has survived and thrived in this life but ocasionally I remember that scene and worry that she did not fare well over time... maximizing risk....

Wow, this blew up since checking in last night.  Understand all the points (except most of Yury, no surprise).   I think it’s possible to agree with the Bruno take AND some of the responses/rebuttals and extensions.  I have two daughters in early HS so this is an important issue that I don’t take lightly any way you slice it.  I have extremely close and intimate relationships (friends, partners, family) with survivors whose situations run the gamut.  I don’t think the advice to avoid being drunk and out of control (risk mitigation in more than just SA scenarios) equates in any way to second guessing clothing types (completely different) or blaming after the fact or “making allowances” for the abuserWhen climbing with my daughters,  we share advice, beta, discuss proper and safe technique, etc but I don’t blame or shame them for falling at the crux. It’s learning and trying and doing our best. We grow and learn together and support each other. I have their backs if shit happens, but we train to avoid shit happening.They know that if the worst happens, THEY drive the bus on what they need and how they want to move forward.  I’ll just listen and take my cues from them.   Maybe they just want hugs and a shoulder to cry on.  Maybe they want a full court press legal-wise.  They won’t feel pressured one way or the other, but if they say there’s a hole needs some fillin’ somewhere…then some holes get filled.  I think one of the key issues with respect to the overall sexual assault problem not yet addressed much in this thread….we are mostly preaching to the choir here, and some of the most dangerous people are in the “choir”  The people we need to identify and root out more so than the cold blooded stranger rapist (which CB seems more and more potentially like, based on the info presented here, which is alarming that he ran amongst us not “under the radar” but fully blipping on screen) but the ones who are “fully against sexual assault” and sincerely believe they are, and yet are guilty of doing it, but don’t see themselves as “that guy”.How do you fight total lack of understanding and self-awareness?

@ Erik, I love biology, and talking about biology and genetics, but there's no way I'm going to go down that road on this thread. Honestly, with no bad intentions and in good faith, if you want to talk about genetics, ancestry, behavior, and so on, PM me, or start another thread, and I'll respond there.Back to the topic:This is a broad, important, thread, and I think the angle that we have been exploring for the last pages, about how we can educate our children, is relevant.  One point: when I, or we, talk about saying things to our children like, "Don't get drunk around people you don't trust," I think this is a very important piece of advice, but of course it is only a small part of a much larger message to stay aware, assess risk, trust your instincts, try not to place yourself in vulnerable situations, and so on.  Of course, this is not always going to be possible, and even if somebody does everything right, assaults will occur, through ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF THE VICTIM.So I am going to push back again on the idea that we should not tell our children to remain vigilant because that is a form of victim shaming.  Such a stance seems to defy common sense and reality, and I think it's dangerous.  We can, and must, separate the very real need to furnish young people with survival skills, from the need to change culture to avoid victim shaming and blaming.

So is THIS the place to talk about "risk mitigation" and that we should teach our kids not to get shit faced with strangers lest they get raped? Especially when, as far as we know, none of the before-mentioned women were assaulted by CB because they got drunk or let themselves get roofied or whatever it is that everyone posting their thoughts on rape prevention thinks women, in general, need to do?

Most people are aware of ways to avoid dangerous situations and about consent and lots of the topics we’ve been talking about. Maybe the biggest place for improvement that can have serious downstream effects is in speaking out against casual objectification and sexualization of people. I think our culture is trending this way but obviously slower than we’d like. Although, we, as a society, also seem to want to be able to objectify and sexualize ourselves without others doing the same.

The situation here, based on the documentation posted about CB's past behavior, seems to be about intimate partner violence rather than parties and situational awareness. CB was engaging in behaviors such as stalking that are part of a pattern of coercive control. This is something that we as climbers can do something about - supporting victims and providing consequences for people we know who engage in abuse. This means that we do have to point out abusive people just like we point out dangerous climbing partners. We wouldn't support someone who drops people, right? Situational awareness is fine, but it is not the whole or even the most important part of the conversation. This whole conversation reminds me of a self-defense class I helped teach. The head instructor spent a lot of time telling women to lock their windows, park their cars under street lights, and look for people waiting under their cars waiting to hamstring them (very unlikely). Not one word about intimate partner or acquaintance violence. Statistically, the women taking the class were more to experience violence from someone they knew than some stranger in the bushes. When teaching the class, we did not prepare the students for the real risks they would face.

Of those, 55 percent were intimate partner violence-related, meaning they occurred at the hands of a former or current partner or the partner’s family or friends. In 93 percent of those cases, the culprit was a current or former romantic partner. The report also bucks the strangers-in-dark-alleys narrative common to televised crime dramas: Strangers perpetrated just 16 percent of all female homicides, fewer than acquaintances and just slightly more than parents.If a self-defense instructor taught something like 60 of 60 minutes on less than half of the risk, do you think it was a good use of time?https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6628a1.htm?s_cid=mm6628a1_wDAMMIT BLOCKEDBut you're the one brushing aside her critique of real vs imagined risks. In the CDC's research, 16% of the murders were from strangers.

I obviously argue that the parent has the responsibility to cut through all the BS and get the job done.   "I wouldn't do that shit if I were you!"  and No I do Not see why its politically incorrect for a parent to not let their kid dress like a sex worker.  All that being said no one seems to have the answers for keeping people out of abusive relationships. Like  a moth to the flame many keep going back for more... ....  I will say again that drugs and alcohol make everything worse and more risky.  is what it is. .. Pretty lady ain't got no friend till the candy man comes around again....   PS.  absolutely nothing I have said is intended to comment on the OP.

Because I know I didn’t say this.We’ve seemed to exhaust this “teaching survival skills to children can help prevent sexual assault” talking point - you’ve been talking about it for pages and everyone seems to agree with you -so…Another way to lessen the incidence of sexual assault is to change the culture. We can also teach our boys to speak up when they hear problematic attitudes, actions/behaviors toward women. I want to ask the men here, when was the last time you showed your disapproval to a guy who was spouting pretty antiquated views toward women? One way to not be a part of a culture that lets rape slide is to confront sexism, misogyny. Men here asking what they can do to be part of the solution and not the problem, here is a good article. How Men Can Confront Other Men About Sexist BehaviorI also agree with Deidre’s point about calling out abusive people in the community. There are threads in the Buy/Sell forum calling out specific users for committing fraud and taking people’s money, or there will be threads here or on FB giving physical descriptions or even pictures of possible thieves and telling the community to look out for them. Vast majority of the comments are very sympathetic. Imagine if people did the same for climbers with abusive histories? Wonder if the comments would be the same.

Everyone in this country is to blame for creating violent people like the accused. We allow our politicians to steal our collective money for the purposes of death and destruction, and in doing so, we neglect everyone's health and welfare. WE have allowed our culture to be obsessed with the domination and subjugation of the weak and vulnerable. I would guess that 95% of those of you in this thread voted for one of the two presidential candidates this past election who were both credibly accused of sexual assault. The lesser of two evils will always be evil, and you knowingly promote it. The Catholic Church still exists, the names of Epstein's client list will never be revealed, sex slaves exist all over the globe, yet we spend our collective money in foreign campaigns to control oil and resources. Until Congress and the military become truly convinced (by us) that we need to focus on problems that have never been addressed globally, we will continue to see cases of rape and assaults on vulnerable classes in our society by individuals, because we our the outcome of our societal goals.

Assualts, abuse, harassment, etc are those who have more power over those....who don't. Nothing new there.And, usually?This isn't a random stranger, it's people we know. Or people your kid's know. Remember that kid on a climbing team preying on younger kid's on the team?It's a tough thing. Raise your kid's to be decent humans....And the natural inclination is to think well of people you know, until it's proven otherwise. Even then, a situation can continue.I don't have a whole lot of answers to this, the worst part of it imo, more so than the low probability stranger encounter.Especially not after this summer. I thought things were glacially improving, but....here we are. I definitely feel less respected as a woman than I have for decades. As to those rare low probability high consequence events, such as I experienced?Read "The Gift of Fear", then decide if you want to share it with your kids.Btw, I'm fairly confident my assailant graduated to murder a few years later, so I was extremely lucky to be "unharmed". That last would have gone against me in court. No real harm done, right???Best, Helen

We should provide therapy and help for all involved. Limiting access to alcohol, however, will not do anything. Most people who are raped trusted their rapist before they were raped.

Outside this case, this an extremely dangerous belief. It is far far easier logistically to provide evidence someone did something, than provide the proof of the opposite. In this very thread, I could say you attacked me. Now provide me with proof you didn't attack me?I would also say socially people side with the people they know. If they don't know them most reasonable people side with outcome of the court. Then like 5% of people; like this thread determine the outcome based on whatever their belief system is regardless of any evidence they might have.

Andrew, not to derail this thread, but I think the way the police treat sexual assault accusations is part of a much bigger problem with law enforcement culture, Misogyny is part of it. Racism too. And the number of law enforcement officers who are members of Oath Keepers and similar groups. I see that as the highly troublesome Big Picture for both law enforcement and the military.

 Given the fact that I've known Charlie since 2001 or so and I hadn't heard anything about assault or sexual assault and that I first learnt about it was from this thread, I wouldn't be surprised if Alex was in the same position.  I knew Charlie had gone to prison but I was mistaken and misinformed on what he'd gone to prison for.  Mikey, I believe you when you say you didn’t know. Its not like he had it tattooed on his forehead... Predators / perpetrators like this divide, distract & create their own storyline.  They play on our innate desire to trust. Tactically, they can be shrewd & clever but maybe not altogether smart. They sometimes don’t think about the big picture, concentrating only on how to manipulate out of their current situation.

He's charged with even more severe crimes, again, against a real human being. Your analogy is so messed up that I'm going to take a moment to break down why. In your mind, calling someone who a court has told him to stay away from makes him less "fearsome." "81% of women who were stalked by a current or former husband or cohabitating partner were also physically assaulted by that partner, while 31% were sexually assaulted. " National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "76% of women murdered by an intimate partner were stalked first, while 85% of women who survived murder attempts were stalked.... 89% of femicide victims who had been physically assaulted before their murder were also stalked in the last year prior to their murder." And this is a guy who has already been convicted of assaulting an ex-partner and has multiple restraining orders. Not very fearsome, huh.Now let's look at the language you use. You compare his actions to a dog's. A dog lacks the same moral responsibility for its actions that a human has. A grownup human is responsible for, among other things, not assaulting, stalking, or raping other humans. Further, you compare him to a puppy. A puppy is cute and innocent. You know what's not cute and innocent? Assaulting ex-partners and stalking them. Alleged rape is also not cute.  You state he's looking for love--what is loving about assault? You then compare the victim(s) to a cat, implying that they're not human. Talk about minimizing the victims' experience.Last, you compare his alleged actions to dry-humping. Go re-read the fucking federal indictment you fucking asshole.[edited to remove some swear words but also add more]

That's why.Since you seem to crave some "hard facts" I'll help you out. Here's the indictment for Charlie's Yosemite Prior that he went to Taft Federal Prison for. Looks like he got pulled over driving drunk in Yosemite (while also under 21) and then, later, slashed the personal vehicle tires of the arresting ranger and, a few days after that, made threats against the same ranger/witness.  Note that the original indictment had to be updated to add witness intimidation. And here's the Federal Judge's current detention order denying the defendant bail pending trial, which is very rare. Take a look at C) Findings of Fact which are written by the judge, not the prosecutor. Note "The weight of evidence against the defendant is high." Also, "The defendant has a significant prior history of crime (violence)."Also, this, a "prior felony conviction for corporal injury to a spouse... number of victims... has recently admitted to having contact with victims with RO in place... history of threats."Guess it wasn't weed he went down for. So I'm gonna stick with the belief that none of the people posting their restraining orders, stories of testifying in a DV case, etc. are making it up. This is just his FEDERAL rap sheet for crimes committed in Yosemite National Park.

Looks like CB and his defense attorney have some disagreements about case strategy. Criminal defense counsel asked the court for 60 more days to review discovery provided by the prosecution and to do their own investigation/preparation. Judge asked if CB would agree to this continuance. CB said no and pushed for speedy trial. The judge split the difference and gave defense counsel 30 days extension. Pacer excerpt below.

Some possibly interesting details on the CB criminal matter. Below screenshots are from two PACER filings. Second one is the  recent status conference report from November confirming that the investigation seized Barrett's digital devices during or after his arrest and has imaged them. Prosecutors asked the defense to provide a 6-Terrabyte drive so they could give them duplicate copies, as is normal in any criminal cases. First image is the most recent status conference report in which it seems the criminal defense attorney is asking for more time to review the multiple TB of evidence while his client is objecting to any continuance or delay and insisting on a "speedy trial."As a result, trial was scheduled for January 31, 2023 start.There was another status conference held yesterday but no report yet about what the outcome was.

I agree with Yuri, the Feds are notorious for making huge 'data dumps' on defense counsel, and not all judges are agreeable to pushing the US Attorneys to be particularly specific in what they intend to introduce. We get some of that in State courts, but, at least here in MA, most of the time, not to the extent or volume as in Federal Court. Still as defense counsel I feel duty bound to try to look through everything, just in case there is something helpful for us in there---rarely is.

Really appreciate your first-hand experience. Would a defense attorney ever ask their client, pointedly, if there's anything the attorney needs to be worried about in the digital discovery, ie. if there's documents that would link the defendant to a crime, etc? Or do you avoid direct inquiries of that sort? I'm also guessing that a US Attorney would always rather get a solid guilty plea than run the risk of acquittal at trial. So if they had smoking gun evidence they would be incentivized to show that in a pre-trial conference of some kind, no? In order to motivate the defendant to accept a plea?

Yes, we do ask those questions, especially if the client's themselves provide us with the devices, asking us to extract what they believe is helpful material. The problem is sometimes that data (even that provided to us by the DAs--who surprisingly often don't preview the material themselves) or devices contain child pornography--possession of which is a serious Federal crime (attorneys possessing it in the course of their representation are NOT exempted) and passing it on in any form, an even more serious one. Of course, we don't always get truthful answers--creating a serious dilemma.As for your second question, it depends--some US Attorneys want pleas, others, in certain circumstances, like to have 'gotchas'.

Good question--even if thread drift--and I will now be at my response limit. We make arrangements to view them at a specific location--usually a room in the prosecutor's office or a police station. It gets even more tricky if we need an expert witness to view the images and the devices--again usually under prosecution supervision--which creates its own set of problems.

So, just to recap and then I'm going to close this thread.Charlie Barrett's trial currently slated to begin on January 31, 2023. Based on his defense lawyer's statements and wishes that seems likely to push, but maybe not. I want to thank Alan Rubin and others for clarifying that the very large digital discovery dump is likely just entire images of CB's devices rather than specific trial exhibits. Therefore just as likely to be RAW photos or HD climbing videos as anything else.

Conference notes from PACER below with updates on possible trial dates, etc. Executive summary is that defense lawyers asked for more time to engage in discovery, retain experts, etc. CB objected to his lawyers' request but judge ruled in favor and set a trial date of May 31, 2023.

I ran into Charlie a few times over the years, never really knew him though. I was wondering what ever happened with this case.Did some googling and found this which shows the court files. https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64936484/united-states-v-barrett/ Looks like the trial got delayed a few times, now set for February 2024. There is a recent doc where he tried to ask for bail again and the government slapped it down pretty hard. Apparently they have recorded jail calls he made trying to get people to threaten witnesses and forge documents for him.

On October 17, 2022 at 1057 hours Barrett placed a phone call to a friend, J.H. On the call J.H. and Barrett discussed what action he should take against the alleged victims because they reported him. J.H. stated “it’s definitely worth like after this all goes down, I don’t know, something.” In response he stated, “oh something will happen that’s for sure…in the courts or not.”What a legal genius.Any ideas who "J.H." is?

It is, whether you like it or not, a large issue. Have things that may not used to have been considered sexual assault or harassment in the past be considered that now? Yes, but I think that says something about those old norms. It’s not hard to ask for consent, or not catcall, or just not make others uncomfortable. Sexual assault isn’t being devalued - people are just being more vocal about it.

I'm sorry, I interpreted Locker's response as "dont be a dumbass" both for men and women. Maybe not worded perfectly but damn, lighten up people.And Hank, the sexual objectification of women involves them being viewed primarily as an object of male sexual desire, rather than as a whole person.  Now, unless you have deleted your past comments, you have made much worse comments yourself and that is my only point. I'm no Jesus freak but the whole " He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone" applies here.

It'd be great if you all could take your theorizing about the "devaluation" of the meaning of sexual assault and mansplaining about what women should and shouldn't do to keep from getting raped to its own thread. This is a topic about a very specific Federal criminal trial about a specific alleged sexual assault of a real person by a very specific individual. It's not an abstraction. There's a lot at stake for everyone involved. I think it's important to keep this place for discussion of developments in that case. And, heading off the inevitable, yeah, I know I participated in some of the derail in the early stages of this discussion. Thanks!

DOGS!!!!!When does it stop??I’ve heard I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’m sorry so so so many times I’m about ready to scream!There were 10 dogs at the Project Wall the other day! 10 fucking dogs!!!I like dogs! I used to have a dog that I simply loved. I understand having a dog. BUT, I don’t care to have dogs constantly brushing up against me, constantly walking over my stuff, constantly sniffing in my pack, constantly drooling over my lunch.Yes, you’re sorry and that’s wonderful, but nothing ever happens after that.  I’ve gotten out of my car or approached the base of the route or walking down the road and a dog runs up to me and barks and barks and barks. I don’t know your dog, I don’t know that he’s friendly, and you standing 50 feet away saying don’t worry he’s friendly, he doesn’t bite, doesn’t really cut it! Your dog needs to be in your control at all times! Most places your dog needs to be on a leash at all times!

Like you would drones, Bluetooth, really anything that is "just the owner's problem". Which I say, then Bruno shows up post a picture of Luna and talks about how they have equal rights to human climbers, but then admits bringing Luna isn't fair to Luna because they can't really watch Luna while climbing. I bring up examples they get ignored and the knife guy comes in and ruins it with talking about shanking a dog because he's an Alpha family protector. The circle of a dog thread begins.

IMHO, dogs need to stay away from the crag.  If you want your dog to be outdoors and enjoy being out, take them on a hike or take them to a park. Dogs sitting at the base of a crag while you climb is not engaging to them and it's a PIA for everyone else.

Mark, there are a couple of problems here. One, leashes are required in Rifle. I know of a Czech climber who, in the late 90s, refused to put put his dog on a leash despite multiple citations. Well, when the ranger finally grew tired of his shit, he hauled him in, found that the climber overstayed his visa, and had him promptly deported. The other problem is that Project wall is literally on the side of the road, and if there is one wall to have a dog on a leash, irrespective of leash laws, this is it. Anyway, I’d never even entertain taking my dog to Project Wall if it is crowded, and she just hibernates at the base.

Here I am, as requested!  Picture of Luna below...went for a long mountain bike ride wirh her today, and she likes to cool down in the water troughs.  @ Jordan...you almost had it right but you might have misconstrued one of my points from the past. You wrote, "...then admits bringing Luna isn't fair to Luna because they can't really watch Luna while climbing."  I stopped bringing Luna to the crag because it distresses her when we climb away from the ground, not because I was worried about watching her.  I dont' need to watch her--her behavior is unimpeachable.  In all seriousness, Mark, I agree with you.  10 dogs at a crag is crazy, dogs should be on leash when and where required, and dogs that bark and bark at strangers should be controlled.

In the interest of taking this thread in a new direction, is there anything we can actually do about badly behaved dog owners and dogs at crags?Maybe those above who say that engaing crag dogs owners in discussion and pointing out the errors of their ways is the only realistic thing we can do. It's hard to immagine much else that is workable. Some crags will be in places with have leash laws, others not.  Where leash laws are in effect, law enforcement could issue citations, but where is the money/time/will to make that happen to any appreciable degree going to come from?  And where leash laws do no apply, there is no legal way to make people put their dogs on a leash.I would suport FAR more extensive education and controls for people to own dogs in the first place, including ongoing check-ins to make sure dogs are not being abused, are healthy, are developing well socially with others dogs and humans, and so on, but again where is the money/time/will to make that happen?I would also support somehting like a "climber's code" or a "climber's with dogs code" that is established and disseminated to help promote best practices.  What else?  Any realistic ideas???

Mark, the attitude of climbers now is literally anything goes as long as they are having fun. In their eyes, you're just being a complainer and raining on the fun parade that is the Rifle scene. I couldn't believe how many dogs were coming up Mount Elbert when I did it last week. Ten miles up and down on a hot rockpile is not what the average dog is made for, nor is sitting around being bored while their owner shouts take for the 50th time. Good luck.

What else?  Any realistic ideas???Don't bring your dog.  Climbing isn't a good activity for a dog to be there.  90% of dogs would be better of not being there.  Seems like more owners think it's an outdoor activity so it should be good for the dog.  It isn't because you hardly interact with the dog, and the dog just gets antsy and loud. It's like taking your dog dirt biking. The dog can't go with you so you can either let it bug everyone else or tie it down and let it bark while you drive away.  Just leave the dog home and take it for a hike or walk when you get back. Climbing is a selfish activity so anyone you bring who isn't climbing is going to need something they can do that doesn't bother everyone. This includes, kids, drone flyers, dogs, wives, bros, etc.  Almost always it's better to just leave them home.  Dogs for the most part should be trained to be left home for a good while so it shouldn't be a big deal.I know it's hard because we see videos of pros/dirt baggers with a scrappy dog that just sits there quietly in a youtube video.  Everyone thinks that's what it looks like with their dog. Reality is very different from that for the majority of dog and dog owners. Dogs need like 16 hours of sleep let them do it while you're climbing at home. Most won't sleep at the crag.Also sorry I got the story wrong about Luna but still kind of the same point it is just better for the dog to not come.

I like bringing my well-behaved dog climbing, and she loves coming climbing, 'cause she likes a short hike followed by hours of lounging and smelling the air/sleeping--she's quite lazy, as dogs can be. BUT, I don't bring her to busy crags during busy times. (I climb at Rumney a lot, and will bring her on weekdays but not weekends, for instance.) Mostly because there's enough of a shit-show going on without us there. I feel like that's a pretty fair approach to this issue.I also always at least have a leash handy and put her on a leash if people are around and she's not actually sound asleep.

I like to qayaq through the ice floes and boulder offshore with ice tools at this time of year. No problem with dogs on the Chukchi Sea, but I do carry a flare gun for the occasional nanuq like this one I saw on Saturday:

Personally, I like taking my dog when I sport climb. It makes her really nervous when I leave the ground and feeds into her separation anxiety, so she cuddles us more when we get home. Evidently, I have not shared a crag with Buff, yet.

Most domesticated animals fall into the animal cruelty category. (I'm sure Luna isn't there she looks great)I'd avoid using the "you must be fun at parties" line its past its prime and paints more of a target on the person using the phrase instead of the intended audience. Lastly everyone should see the alps before those glaciers go. Because in a few decades they're going to look like the Wasatch Front with more brown and a lot less green.

I can see Bruno now letting his dog soak its asshole in a public drinking water supply and telling the guy giving him a ticket that he must be fun at parties. We actually have a lake down the street that the whole town drinks from(public water supply), its closed to swimming and pets with signs indicating those rules all over any accessible spot and guess what? Some entitled people just dont give a fuck, its basically the definition of narcissism especially since there are about a dozen open to the public lakes within 5-10 minutes.

I would just like to say, I am a beginner, and have only went out on rock a few times. One of those times I saw a dog. That one time I saw a dog, it was laying very quietly next to it's owners who were climbing. We walked relatively close past them, and the dog watched us go, never moving from it's spot, never making a sound.Dogs aren't the problem, lazy dog owners are. If you don't have time or you don't want to put in the effort to train your dog, then it is a stay-at-home dog.

I would just like to say, I am a beginner, and have only went out on rock a few times. One of those times I saw a dog. That one time I saw a dog, it was laying very quietly next to it's owners who were climbing. We walked relatively close past them, and the dog watched us go, never moving from it's spot, never making a sound.Dogs aren't the problem, lazy dog owners are. If you don't have time or you don't want to put in the effort to train your dog, then it is a stay-at-home dog. What a great contribution to the conversation.

I'm glad this is thread. If you have a loud barking dog at a crag, fuck you, you're an asshole. Either get a dog that can stay quiet, get a muzzle, or don't bring your dog -- we all hate you, we just don't feel like making the day you made worse even worse by telling you off because it's not actually going to improve anything.Sometimes it's just really obnoxious. Another time one climber basically took over an entire wall and my partner and I decided to leave because there was a dog loudly barking for several minutes and it seemed it wasn't going to stop.If you have a well-behaved, quiet dog, thank you for making my day better. I love dogs.

Kids!!!!!When does it stop??I’ve heard I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I’m sorry so so so many times I’m about ready to scream!There were 10 kids at the Project Wall the other day! 10 fucking children!!!I like kids! I used to have a child that I simply loved. I understand having a toddler. BUT, I don’t care to have little gremlins constantly brushing up against me, constantly walking over my stuff, constantly sniffing in my pack, constantly drooling over my lunch.Yes, you’re sorry and that’s wonderful, but nothing ever happens after that.  I’ve gotten out of my car or approached the base of the route or walking down the road and a feral child runs up to me and barks and barks and barks. I don’t know your kid, I don’t know that he’s friendly, and you standing 50 feet away saying don’t worry he’s friendly, he doesn’t bite, doesn’t really cut it! Your kid needs to be in your control at all times! Most places your  kid needs to be on a leash at all times!

Sorry. Bruno helps illustrate an interesting phenomena. In the last 50-years, dogs have gone from being mostly treated as indentured farmhands to being literally actually coddled in bed, up in the big house. The rest of the farm animals are resentful of it too. Now that dogs have ingratiated themselves into the inner circle of human family-groups, they enjoy more protections than ever. Look for a push for formal recognition of basic pet rights and challenges to pet discrimination. So whether its emo-support dogs on airplanes or in restaurants, dogs in the supermarket, dogs at the crag - you haven't got a chance.

A simple solution that neatly and effectively deals with those pesky and annoying critters that invade your space and ruin an otherwise perfect day of climbing is bear spray.  Apply judiciously and only enough to get the job done.  No need to be vindictive.  Once the boulderers have started to depart the area, cease and desist.  I don’t think I’d have the heart to use it on dogs, though.

In the interest of taking this thread in a new direction, is there anything we can actually do about badly behaved dog owners and dogs at crags?Well, at some point the issue with dogs at crags is going to start threatening climbing access.  All it would take is a dog bite and a land owner being sued to lose access in some areas.  So maybe the answer is to start pushing for dog bans at more areas before climbing access is threatened.  A lot or crags fall under the management of national, state, or local parks.  I could see more state or local parks treating dogs more like the national parks do, and just not allowing them in many areas.I get that it's an unpopular thing to do, but the issue seems to just get worse every year.  At some point it will become necessary.  Dog owners are a user group just like any other, and like any other user group, a few bad apples can ruin it for everyone.

Then they remember they own a dog who for the most part loves to run, chew on stuff and has tons of energy.  They think I better take the dog.  They show up with the best of intentions to keep the dog leashed.  Strangely enough the dog hates being on a leash while the owner disappears out of sight topping out.  They think ehhh won't hurt to take the dog of the leash.  So, they do it.  Which inspires a few other dummy dog owners to do the same.  Now on a busy weekend in a premier spot, in prime conditions, one dog owner has single handedly negatively affected everyone in the area and put access at risk. Let's say they keep the dog on the leash.  Now all it does is bark and whine because all it sees is the owner abandoning it over and over again.  Does the dog think oh they'll come back.  No, it doesn't because it's a dog that doesn't think that way.  Some do but most have separation anxiety and will just bark non-stop.  If everyone with a dog did it like Todd here, I guarantee there wouldn't be posts like this all the time. Reality is most dog encounters are like the posts above.

Hey man, I like dogs but this happens a lot and all I hear is I’m sorry. you have to respect my right to not be harassed by your dog. He was nice and put a leash on the dog, but that should be more of the rule than the exception. Mark, the park has a dogs must be on leash requirement.  I have to say that changing behavior of anyone, let alone dog owners, is difficult, but it was your request that he put his animal under control ie leash was the act that was nice.  His response was adherence to an ignored requirement and he probably knew it.  Will his behavior change?  Only if he gets similar responses always.  Do we walk away or confront when someone is infringing on our rights to expect folks to manage their pet appropriately…

All dogs are emotional support animals at some level. People who love dogs are actually very emotionally unstable and needy. Having a companion allows them to feel more comfortable in a world where they lack confidence.

Sounds like you have too. Therefore, there is still a majority of dog owners who need to learn that for the dog's sake and those around them.

Mostly at remote, empty crags thankfully, because all three whine and bark while their owner is climbing. On a trip last year, one of the dogs bit me on two different occasions when I got too close. It had also bitten my partner's wife apparently, so I wasn't to feel bad? Anyway, good news is, cutting his balls off helped.

I was once "set up" by a friend of mine Barry who has a female friend whom he thought I might enjoy meeting.  We were both really into climbing and both computer scientists, etc.  So I showed up and meet "Dana" at the crag; also present is Barry and Dana's dog, a black lab named Luna (I am not making this up).  So I took the first lead and Dana belays me (I know... that's a lot of trust off the bat!) and Barry is playing with Luna.  Then Dana takes a burn and I belay.  Then Barry's turn and I belay while Dana is on her phone and suddenly I look over and this dog is tearing through my pack!  I can't do much because I'm belaying and about 5 meters away from my pack, so I yell out, "Hey, your dog is tearing up my pack!" while Dana continues looking at her phone.  "Excuse me!!!"  She still looks up at me, shrugs, and goes back to her phone.  The dog has now pulled some of my lunch out of my dog and is chewing up a sandwich.  Barry lowers off and I, trying to maintain my composure, say, "hey, your dog just ate my lunch!"  She finally responds, "well, if you wanted to save your lunch maybe you shouldn't leave it out around wild animals."  Finally I said, "Well, if this is a wild animal I guess I'm free to treat it like a wild animal!"  At this point Barry intervenes to calm the situation down.  Later he offers me part of his lunch since mine has dog slobber on it.  I've never spoken to this woman again and I still tell Barry what a horrible person I think she is... he defends her.

Hi Nate.  Something about your story doesn't ring true.  People don't usually say things like, "Well, if you wanted to save your lunch maybe you shouldn't leave it out around wild animals," unless they are angry.  Could you have done anything to provoke such a response? Below, in the spirit of this thread, I've adjusted your story somewhat to reflect a more probable series of events.  Nate was once set up on a date by his friend Barry, who has a female friend, named Brunhilda, whom he thought Nate might enjoy meeting.  They were both really into climbing, both computer scientists, etc.  Brunhilda resisted this meeting for a long time.  She had bad luck with climbers and computer scientists--they were all so narcissistic and egotistical--but she finally relented, because her friend Barry was so persuasive.  On the apppointed day, she took her beloved black labroador Luna along with her, so that if Nate turned out to be unappealing (as she suspected he would) at least have her best friiend as backup.  They all met.  As soon as Nate saw Luna, he stiffened and gritted his teath, and Brunhilda realized that he was not a dog person. Luna went up to great Nate with a friendly tail wag nose sniff, but he pulled his hand away.  This confirmed Brunhilda's fears.  They started climbing.  Nate took the first lead as Brunhilda belayed, while Barry played with Luna.  Why are men always so eager to show off, Brunhilda wondered?  Why couldn't Barry climb first?  He set this whole thing up.  Or what about chivalry, and ladies first?  I guess you couldn't expect any social grace from a non dog lover, she reasoned.  Brunhilda climbed next, somewhat uncomfortable that Nate would leer at her from below.  Then Barry climbed while Nate belayed.  Realizing that there was no chance for her and Nate, Brunhilda began to scroll through a dating app, wondering is she could salvage the weekend.  What about that friendly-looking guy with the golden retriever?  She began writing him a text.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Nate stiffen and grit his teeth once more.  Luna had edged close to him for affection.  She was a sweet dog and only wanted to be close to people.  Unfortunately, Nate seemed incapable of returning selfless love.  He certainly wasn't boyfriend material, much less father material. Brunhilda never understand people who didn't like dogs or kids, or always expected dogs and kids to behave perfectly.  Who would want to be with somebody who was more worried about the germs in dog saliva, or the bacteria on children's hands, than the obvious joy and love they brought?As little sympathy as Brunhilda had for Nate, when she saw Luna approach Nate's pack, she was on the verge of calling out Luna's name to distract her with a treat.  Then Nate shouted in rage, his face twisted into a grotesque mask, "Hey, your dog is tearing up my pack!"  That sealed it.  Nobody that rude and aggressive was worth the effort.  "Well, if you wanted to save your lunch maybe you shouldn't leave it out around wild animals," Brunhilda responded, hoping that Nate picked up on her dismissive tone.  Usually, she kept a close eye on Luna, but she thought that Nate had forfeitted his right to polite behavior by being so unfriendly.  Secretly, she was pround that Luna ate his lunch. Nate lowered Barry to the ground.  They departed just as a large, noisy group of sport climbers arrived, with boom boxes, hammocks, and joints.  That evening, Brunhilda contacted the guy with the golden retriever.  It was love at first sight, and the next day they went climbing while their dogs frolicked in the alpine meadows.

Wait-  there is one remaining useful thing to wring from this thread….my near death experience at the hands of sheep.  This could save your own life someday.So there I was, freshly bailed from a solo North Face Matterhorn attempt (when you’re the only one on the mountain, it should tell you something.  This time I listened)   But I listened too late to catch the last ride down.   So I decided to just explore and take the long way home.  I wandered down across the north face and crossed the Zmuttbach to the north side, taking trails up under the Gabelhorn heading back towards Zermatt.  Some of these trails are thin, with steep and long drops below.   In typical “Mountain Murphy’s Law”, at just such a narrow steep section, I met a frickin herd of sheep coming the other way.   Hmmm, “how’s this gonna work” I thought.   Well, the sheep had the answer…just knock this bloke off the mountain!I tried to stick as close as possible to the high inside of the trail, but somehow a couple hundred pounds of insistent ram got between me and the inside wall and then suddenly I’m being pinballed by sheep to the outside cliff edge where a bone crunching, tumbling end awaited.   Having no choice, and no crag dog help in sight, I yelled and spazzed out, bringing a slight pause to the flow of sheep, which gave me just enough time to weave back up towards the wall and get a bit higher before the flow resumed.   This time I aggressively kicked any fuckers that tried to get between me and the wall and eventually it was over.  I estimated several hundred sheep passed.   I skipped any more impromptu climbs or trail explorations and headed straight for beers in the valley.Sometimes, even to this day, I get triggered by a few of Fritz’s gote pics, as those sheep had the same “fuck you” look in their eyes.  Most experienced alpinists only think of sheep in terms of pleasure, but they can definitely kill ya if you let your guard down

I quickly learned to carry a big stick with me everywhere I went, or risk being shredded by those small mangy, but aggressive mutts. Now, whenever a dog growls, or barks at me, I get a visceral response to respond aggressively. It doesn't matter if it's Aunt Gertrude's Pekinese, or any other dog. I think dogs can sense that reaction in me and are in turn somehow triggered towards me. I wish it wasn't so.Once, while mtbing in Upper Bidwell Park above Chico, I was accosted by two Great Danes that burst out of the bushes, growling and circling me. They had their tails and ears docked, and large pig-hunting type collars on. I'm sure they were guarding someone's illegal grow or cook house. After what seemed an eternity, with me backing down the trail, trying to keep my bike between them and me, and doing my best to sound full of bravado, they disappeared back into the brush. From then on I've always carried a small can of bear spray and a 7 inch Fairbairn Sykes fighting knife that was my great grandfathers. I also painted a grimacing face on the top of my helmet, in the hopes of keeping Pumas at bay. Learned that trick from a NatGeo show on the Sundarban honey hunters.

Take my previous comment, for example. Of course, up votes and attention isn't why one should be/do those things, but I bring it up because people seem to respond more when it's the opposite. My point being, people always say they want a better world, but good behavior isn't praised enough or at all and often the response to that is, "well, fuck it, nobody cares anyway, why should I?"It's a very much thankless world we live in and it shows by how careless people have become.

I just got a dog a few months ago and I’ve taught her that the leash and being tied up are sometimes part of dog life. Nbd, she runs around the ranch I live at plenty. Just chiming in here because I am shocked at the number of people who have surprisingly said, “You keep your dog on a leash?” Cracks me up every time because apparently no matter how much people complain about unmanaged dogs, many dog owners are still totally clueless that this is a problem for others and that done properly dogs learn that leashes and crates really are nbd and part of dog life in this human world. Also, I don’t think any of them are reading this post but I totally get needing to vent, so let it out!

@ Heidi,Hi--welcome to the dog family. You might not recognize my name, but if you stick around this thread, we'll become aquainted.  I'm the self-appointed defender of dogs' rights 'round these parts.  I also like to post pictures of my dog, Luna.  (At the bottom of this post is a picture of Luna sleeping in MY bed in MY pillow space.  I've been pushed out of my own bed).Whenever the comments start drifting too much into the anti-dog direction (see recent posts above) I like to bring things back to reality.  Regarding your post, I've got no real problems, except perhaps this part: "Cracks me up every time because apparently no matter how much people complain about unmanaged dogs, many dog owners are still totally clueless that this is a problem for others." The problem (as we have been over many times) is that different people have different views of what an "unmanged dog" looks like and exactly how, when, and why we should "manage" our dogs. For example, nice natural wild area, no leash laws, people hiking, climbing, whatever, one person's idea of a dog living the good life, running round having fun, is another person's idea of an frightening, filthy, larcenous, pestilent beast.  For every person who says, "I am entitled to walk around unbothered by dogs," I would say, "You have an entitled attitude to beleive that you can go out into public spaces and not mix with the public."  What cracks me up is how these threads just keep going and going and going...who knew that dogs would be more divisive than Obama vs Trump, gun regulations, religion, or the correct way to use Grigri?Be sure to let your dog play off leash sometimes!  They need to learn to be on leash, but they also deserve to be free occasionally, even if it makes some people uncomfortable.

Hey MPers, recently I was diagnosed with leukemia and have had a PICC line inserted in me.I’m wondering if anyone has any experience about climbing with a PICC or port while undergoing treatment. Most sites mention to avoid strenuous activity/contact sports, but If I’m not bashing my arm against things it seems reasonably safe?I would probably stick to indoor stuff for now just to rebuild my base fitness such as indoor bouldering/TR where falls are minimal or on a big mat. Looking for other stories and thanks again!

PICC lines can migrate inside your body due to physical activity and lead to complications. A central port (generally placed high on your right chest) would probably be better to avoid that risk, I would discuss this with your healthcare provider and tell them the whys and whats. Of course, there is what they recommend and what you deem necessary to maintaining sanity but you also don’t want to get the “non-compliant patient” label, it may affect your treatment.I wish you the best in your treatment and recovery.

Bleeding around the site is likely. I had a PICC years ago and was unable to climb because of other medical problems. However, climbing with one sounds unpleasant and risky.

I have had both, and the port wins 1000%. I have the port now, and I would not hesitate to climb moderately if I was otherwise able, but my Leukemia and the resulting anemia precludes any such physicality.A PICC line leaves IV tubing and port(s) hanging off your bicep/inner arm which is taped to the arm or held in place with an expanding tube bandage sleeve. The PICC line maintains an opening through the skin where this tubing enters the body and is a common point of infection. My line needed to be maintained daily with heparin flushes, and weekly for bandage replacement by oncology nurses. It is not a complicated procedure that my wife and I could DIY, but I had so many clinic visits, it was easy to have this done weekly in clinic.  The PICC line went right through part of my bicep and as a reuslt I never had full range of movement with it, it was too uncomfortable, and would move slightly making the insertion point hurt. As stated above it could have also migrated. You don't want the internal end of the catheter in the wrong place! I would be downright scared to try to climb with that line. Compared to having multiple IV sticks, missed and blown veins etc, the PICC line was better than nothing at the time, but compared to a port? No contest. Port wins.I asked the NP who installed my port a lot of questions when I was having it installed, including whether there would be any physical restrictions with the port, including climbing, and working out. She said only while the incision is healing. I also asked about locating it so I could carry a pack. She installed it a bit more towards the sternum, and carrying a daypack is fine. I had the port installed close to a year ago and it has been a Godsend. It is currently being accessed 2x/week, and feels like part of me. No muss, no fuss, easy peasy.Despite my N=1 personal experience with it, do check with your provider.

Echoing above sentiments: PICC line is a poor match up with climbing due to all the overhead reaching, etc. While this doesn't constitute any sort of medical advise: a port would be much less likely to become complicated. There are different approaches to ports. Perhaps discuss with the doc who is going to be placing it your intention to climb, knowing they are unlikely to recommend you do so.

I climbed (very poorly) through chemo and would be happy to talk any time.  As stated above, climbing with a picc is a bad idea.  Depending on your chemo schedule you might be able to have it pulled and reinserted.  If not a port is the way to go.

My middle son (22)  is on cycle 2 for Hodgkins. He has a Picc.  they couldn't give him a port due to inflammation in neck due to Hodgkin's.  after two of six cycles port is back on table. but really climbing still isn't.  The other aspect not mentioned above is the immunosuppression you'll be dealing with.  cuts, scrapes, bruises, are a much bigger deal with your palette count is way low and your ANC is below 500.  My oldest son also dealt with ALL when he was 4, so I've got a "parental PHd" in this shit..    Tough times don't last but tough men do....as Hippy said, talk any time

One more well wisher here and another vote for a port if it’s an option. I wasn’t a climber when I went through treatment but once the insertion site healed I was comfortable with everything from working out as I was able to having a young nephew punch it as my on/off power button. You should of course listen to your docs but I wouldn’t hesitate to climb with a port. I would strongly recommend that you go climb if you can get the ok from your doctor. Chemo is hard enough. Do what you love when you can. I truly believe it helps. Now I’m another kind of statistic. 11 years and counting. I hope you’ll recover as well and climb through it all. Fuck cancer!

First if all, best of luck and speedy recovery. Dealing with this shit and trying to keep a chin up is difficult.I had a broviac and climbed. It terrified the hell out of me every time and that was just in the gym. Something I did start doing to give me a bit of comfort was wrap plastic wrap around the lines, over my chest. This kept them from getting snagged. At the time I was only over TRing vertical stuff too. Years later I was offered the chance to have a port implanted and nearly took it. There is a thread buried somewhere where someone cooked up a "shield" to go over it. Not sure where that went.Either way, my two cents is just being ultra conservative and cautious. Best wishes

As I've spent more time climbing granite spires and especially desert towers, I've amassed a large collection of photographs that others have falsely identified as penises. What are your best photos that sank peoples minds into the gutter?Ideally, identify your tower, as I think it would be fun to have a towers penis tick list amassed from this discussion...The following are just the best of my photos, but I could add plenty more towers to the list, depending on the 'likeness' criteria used to constrain selection.The PhallusThe Lovers (in profile)The Lovers (from the side - not knowing the name until recently, I nicknamed this one "Little Wanker")Argon TowerDark AngelDark Angel 'Rorschach test'Dark Angel image that I made for marking desert towers in Google Earth... then I realized that I had inadvertently populated most of SE Utah with little orange dicks!

I bought a pair of those Tao at IME back then and immediately went over to the South Buttress on a sunny day. By the third pitch that weird black "material" felt like it had shrink wrapped my feet in a burning synthetic hell. I have referred to those often as the worst shoe I ever bought.

OMG I can't believe I'm about to disagree with Hank Caylor but the Synchro and not the Kendo was the best climbing shoe ever made. This comment has nothing to do with this post. LONG LIVE THE SYNCHRO, BITCHES! That is all.  outdoorreview.com/product/p…

That is not the Tao. The Tao had a slingshot rand and was not particularly soft. I don’t recall ever seeing the OP’s shoes before. Perhaps a proto-Mythos?  The original Mythos were black after all. Also, on second look, if you remove the laces, the shoe does look a bit like a black Ballerina  As for the Kendo, they were fantastic…for their time. A more painful shoe I have never worn.

I wonder if the Tao's are what I started out with. I never figured out the model - similar to the Mythos but if they've never changed in like 30 years these aren't Mythos. Big difference I see is the top 3 lace eyelets are naked and don't have metal grommets.

The Sliportiva was released in 1988 to coincide with with the years highest grossing film, "Who Framed Rodger Rabbit." Sportiva was breaking into US sales, and like most euro-centric companies, they figured the US consumer was much less refined than we actually were. Thus the crossover into the Zemeckis film. You can see the product placement in many scenes, especially the classic escape scene where Rodger had to scale the sheer wall. Doubt me if you want, but dust off that old VHS player and play it back to see the true origins of the... Sliportiva.

I think LR is on the right track, it looks to be a lace up Ballerina variation. Look at the upper design in the yellow, slip on version, from the catalogue below, and see how it matches with the OP's image. The heel cup is certainly different enough to shed some doubt. Rare shoe for sure. Have you tried contacting an OG at Sportiva?An actual set of Lace Ballerinas can be seen here in the museum collection.https://www.karabinclimbingmuseum.com/shoes.htmlCould always check with Heinz Mariacher who made the original, he would know if he s still around?https://lafabriqueverticale.com/en/heinz-mariacher-a-fantastic-designer/

Try this, and scroll down to the twelfth entry:http://www.outdoorreview.com/brands/la-sportiva.html?pg=1The number of lace holes is similar, although I imagine that the exact number depends on the shoe size.

Oh... My... God...Been looking for any trace of these shoes for years and years. I FOUND a pair of these at a crag in the Peak District circa 1990. (Clearly left behind and pre internet no way of ever reuniting them with the owner.) Nobody I knew at the time had seen or heard of them and  I worked in a climbing shop (Outside @ Hathersage) at the time. The assumption was that they must have been some sort of prototype that some sponsored hero had left behind and I felt rather special when wearing them knowing I had something rather exclusive. I now wonder if the original owner was Neil Gresham. .. https://www.neilgresham.com/sponsors/la-sportiva(Certainly around Sheffield at the time). Guess I ought to get in touch.This is the first and only image I've ever found of them so thanks for posting it. Would be great to find out if they did indeed make it into production. Will try and see if I can find a picture of mine somewhere.

I am hoping to get there in January as I have been invited to speak at a couple of mountain festivals in Scotland. I also haven't had a good Scottish winter suffer-fest since 2014, I perversely miss it.

This one might be the culmination of the Mont-Blanc Lines project, at least on the European side: all six of the mythical Great North Faces of the Alps, together in a single (monstruous) pair of posters: all 222 existing lines, or only the six classic lines (Heckmair, Cassin, Schmid, Allain-Leninger and Comici-Dimai).It took a lot of effort over the past couple of years, and I only got good shots of the remaining two faces during my trip last June. And of course, there are the dozens (hundreds?) of hours researching ascents and drawing lines...Direct Link:  static.wixstatic.com/media/… 1Poster:  montblanclines.com/product-…Direct Link:  static.wixstatic.com/media/…Poster:  montblanclines.com/product-…

Unique size (60x90cm or 24x36"), which means El Cap and Squamish are not available, black wood frame and fine art prints on 250g archival paper. It's already all online in the size options.

Ben Nevis has been near the top of the list since the very beginning of the project, but it took until this spring for me to manage a trip to Scotland to get the image I wanted in winter-ish conditions. Here are 217 routes on the most legendary crag of Scottish winter climbing:Poster and route list:  montblanclines.com/product-…Direct link:  static.wixstatic.com/media/… 1

 I would like to but based on the guidebook couldn't see enough difference from el grandote with my angle to actually draw it. If you know the area well, I would be happy to hear your thoughts on it.Hi Alex,It was great to meet you at lover’s leap. You showed us the full resolution image and I was blown away. Re above: El whampo goes to the top, but only the splitter pitch is distinct. I’ve done the climb 3 times with 3 seperate low quality exits to the splitter. I would think you could just label the distinct crack, which is next to the less obvious el grandote feature. Even now 12 years later, I think that splitter is one of the best I’ve done at any grade, even if the end sucks. Cheers,Will

Ran out of time in 2021, and ended up postponing my trip to the Sierra last June, for obvious snowy reasons. Tuolumne and the east face on Whitney were also on the list.

Completely unsolicited suggestions here but a high def poster of specifically mt Whitney would probably do crazy numbers for climbers and hikers alike. Also Mt Russell and some other high Sierra mega classics. I’d buy both!

I tried to do it twice, but in 2021 ran out of time, and snow kept me out earlier this summer, so still no Hulk or Whitney, even though I would absolutely love to have both and more from the Sierra.

I couldn't be happier to announce that the English edition of the book has received the prestigious 2023 Mountain Image Award from the Banff Centre Mountain Film Festival! It's a huge honor, and I'll be at the festival for the award, as well as to speak about the book alongside Jeff Smoot and to sign copies. Let me know if any of you is planning to be there!

I stayed at these for the PCT, rather than climbing buuutttt:The Hostel California (THC) in Bishop, CA is has enormous character. The huge bags of communal pot and weed plants in growing in the courtyard can tell you a lot about this place. Tons of space to kick back and free crashpad rentals. Bed/bath is also comfortable and clean.Runner up is Bunk+Brew in Bend, OR. They give you a free beer from their permanent food trucks in the courtyard upon check in.Not exciting stories, but worth mentioning these two pretty remarkable places for any dirtbag wandering that way. I forgot which hostel was the one where I wanted to absolutely MURDER someone in their sleep for snoring all through the night, but that's not on the hostel.

Another person got up in the middle of the night after shaking the bed, the snorer didn't wake up, and guy just straight left and slept in the lounge. Snoring-man woke up the next morning all smiley, said "good morning" and the other three of us wanted to punch in his teeth so bad. There's snoring, and then there's this guy (who probably has sleep apnea but doesn't know it?). I get that dealing with others is a whole part of the experience but holy fuck, this was absurd.
