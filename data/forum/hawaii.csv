A good friend of mine is one of the earlier developers on Oahu and is responsible for bringing Ti hardware to the state. This is what I know…There is pretty good climbing on Oahu and Maui, and there is some hard to find mediocre limestone on Kawaii. As for the Big Island, there is DWS at Southpoint.

123613692,"Jan 1, 2023",SenorDB,"The two best bets for climbing on your trip are Pi'ikea Gulch and South Point. Pi'ikea is chill bouldering with mostly good gravel landings and short TRs. South Point is also good for DWS and has less intense swimming conditions than End of The World (most of the time this place feels like a ride inside the washing machine).There's also countless amazing other things to do and see on the Big island that don't involve climbing and can only be experience here. For example, parking at the Koai'a Tree Sanctuary, a neat place to check out, and walk up the dirt road on the east side of the sanctuary to the Kohala Forest Reserve- a spectacular otherworldly experience once inside. Although it feels like you might run into a Velociraptor at any moment, there's only a bunch of pig and hunter trails that go deep into the forest. No climbing but it would be easy to get turned around and lost inside if not paying attention. Also, a likely place to have that intrepid pig encounter! But for my money I'd put ALL of my effort on that short trip into poking lava with a stick first. Just sayin.",6,Old Pueblo,Apr 2012,"Points: 8,070",4.492462311557789

We have simultaneously taken on pet/ house sitting gigs, FREE of charge. These opportunities provide us with 'creature comforts' (showers, spaces to telework from, etc) and in return alleviate financial stress on your end. Since this has been very successful in Colorado we wanted to expand our offering to places we have yet to travel together to- Thus, Hawaii! To be clear, this would provide us with a taste of a new city/ state/ culture and place to stay. It would not be treated as a vacation. Experience;We have had a myriad of pets throughout our lives and have pet-sat for a host of friends (whether it be long or short term). I am also a trail runner, should you have a doggo that needs to be run. :) In addition, we would be happy to take care of plants, retrieve mail, and ensure your home is as clean as you left it (bedding will be washed, floors swept, etc).About Us;We are introverts who enjoy lots of quiet time as well as partaking in outdoor activities (rock climbing, running, biking, etc). We will happily honor any house rules you may have, and will treat your home respectfully. We would be happy to meet in-person for your departure and arrival, or simply leave your keys in a secure location and communicate via text (the latter is often easier as traveling can be a little stressful).References;Happy to provide references upon request as well as to meet via zoom and/or in-person prior to commitment to ensure both parties are comfortable with the arrangement. We are currently booked for the Month of June and a good portion of July, as well as the month of October and November 19-December 1. That being said the Christmas/ NYE timeframe is 100% available as well as early next year 2023. Let me know your needs and we can chat! Start/ End Dates, Preferences;As we both telework and have few responsibilities of our own, our start and end dates are very flexible. Regarding duration, 1-3 weeks is preferred (as we will have to take some time off work and buy plane tickets). All arrangements would be ""live-in"".

On some  trails it may take 2+ hrs to go a mile. Not much that is ""off the tourist radar"", although there are plenty of longer hikes that don't see much traffic beyond the lower portions. Get on AllTrails, pick a trail, and go for it. Make sure you download a map, trails are often poorly or misleadingly marked if they are marked at all, and there are tons of hunting trails and side trails that can get you into trouble. Not sure what kind of water sports you're looking for, but there is no shortage of water sports in Hawaii.

I’m looking for experienced guides or climbers with rope experience and an interest in guiding to start building up a guide team. Significant preference given to AMGA SPI, WFR, WFA, NOLS, or other professional certification or training. Preference given to those who are vaccinated, but not mandatory. Can train the right cantidate, but experience setting up rappels or a strong recreational lead climbing background is mandatory.  Guiding will take place on the largest privately owned waterfall in Hawaii, 120 foot Kulapiania falls, along with 4 smaller waterfalls. Housing can be provided to those who are interested. Operation is located on 52 acres with fruit trees and an organic farm. Guides can gain access to community meals and farm food with a contribution of one day of farm help per week.This is a position with an operation that was an established guide company before the pandemic, but has been shut down for over 1.5 years. Gear, systems and insurance are up to date and the property owner has significant interest in providing the resources to make this a successful guide company again. Cruise ship season will be starting in Hilo early November, and it would be great to have a trained guide team out here by then. Available Positions:Lead Rappel GuideSecond Rappel GuideLava Tube Caving GuideThis is a unique situation as far as guiding operations go, as it has the potential to be a source of year-round employment within an otherwise seasonal industry, with housing provided, on a tropical island. Reach out to Eric for more info or to schedule an interview (412) 418-3338www.Waterfall.net/rappelling",4,"pittsburgh, pa",Aug 2015,Points: 35,5.170068027210885

We're looking for advice on short term housing in the area, and anything else helpful to know as someone who's never been before. From what I've read, it can be very hard to find housing of any kind, and most landlords want long term tenants, understandably. I've also read that they're (kinda?) cracking down on AirBnb rentals, and we struggle with the ethics of that industry due to the impact it's had on housing in the cities we spend time in. As far as I can tell that just leaves Craigslist and word of mouth. Any other resources to know about?As far as climbing goes, what's the best gym in the area?

117699907,"Sep 5, 2019",Eric J,"I visited Oahu in 2018 and 2019 and stayed in Airbnbs/Homeaways both times, evidently before this Airbnb crackdown occurred (started on August 1st, for those wondering). If I understand the new law correctly, rentals in ""resort areas"" (including Waikiki) are legal, as are rentals longer than 30 days. So in any case, if you're renting more than 30 days, you should be good to go in terms of legality. Also note that if you do stay in an illegal airbnb, only the owner is at risk of fines. You are only at risk of having your housing unexpectedly cancelled.From what we looked at, airbnbs were FAR cheaper than hotels, and then you also get a kitchen/laundry/utensils/cooking supplies and other commodities, so I would go that route if you're able.I didn't do any climbing there, but the two major climbing areas are Mokule'ia and Makapu'u. If you've never been to Oahu before, and enjoy hiking, there are more than enough hikes and other activities to occupy you for 4-6 weeks I would say.The user 20 kN is an admin on here that I believe is involved with Mokule'ia, he may be a good resource for other climbing questions.",2,"St. Louis, MO",Feb 2019,Points: 0,4.7055837563451774

Meetup.com is a good place to connect with people and they’re constantly doing stuff outside. Hilo is a goodly sized town, about 40K, where you’ll have no trouble meeting people and at one time they had a small co-op style climbing gym so I know there’s climbers there.

Hawaii is a super special place and if you have an opportunity to live there for a while I say go for it! I’d be happy to climb with you when I’m in town.

But I’d prob find a new hobby that has to do with the ocean and climb just for fun a couple times a week while you live out there.   Hilo is the north and end of the world is on the south side. Also there is like no community for climbing that I know of. But it’s Hawaii. So I’d give up climbing to move there and experience what the island has to offer. IF you don’t like it, move back.

Almost nobody lead anything. Just tie your rope to the parachute cord and set up a TR. Very strange, but kind of cool. I thought the grades were very sandbagged. There were a lot of climbers and they were all very friendly. I bet it would be easy to meet partners there. Also, a great view of the ocean.I was there in January and it was very hot and humid.

Prices were around $10 per night (IIRC) but note that reservations are only by 3- or 5-day weekend blocks (depending on the campground). For one weekend we stayed at Kaiaka Beach Park and it was awesome, tent pitched right on the beach with tons of open space all around, low key and yet pretty close to Haleiwa town. Closest campground to the climbing at Mokule`ia Wall (the two nearer campgrounds were closed when we were there). We had a couple great mornings at Mokule`ia - the climbing is as good as any basalt crag in the mainland U.S., and the local/community vibe is just wonderful.

There is even a 7-pitch sport climb there. Oahu probably has round 50 sport climbs in the .11 - .12 range. Some climbers come Oahu thinking they are going to onsight all of them but find they are harder than they thought and end up taking awhile before sending them. The climbing on Oahu is not very straightforward and involves a lot of technique. Gym strength wont do too much for many of the routes.

As far as finding partners, Oahu has a large military presence which means there are lots of young, athletic people who are interested in climbing. When I climbed there I never even bothered finding a partner I just hiked to the crag and had no problem finding groups of young people with odd numbers.

I looked up Mokule'ia Wall and read that pull cords are already attached to the anchors so you can setup a top rope from the bottom, since the cliff top isn't too solid for walking around and setting them up.  I found a picture and some comments saying that the anchor is just a single rap ring.  Is that true?  That's what the picture I found shows also.  Is the rap ring stainless or something?  The rap rings I'm familiar with around here are aluminum and would hardly stand up to the abuse of repeated top roping, so wondering if these are solid seeing they are the only thing keeping your rope up.

TR off of fixed gear is typically based on local ethics. If you check the route DB here you find:   ""This area is equipped to be easily top-roped. Most of the routes will have strings running from the ground to the anchor and back to the ground so you can clove hitch your rope and pull it through the anchors at the top.""   In the comments, one person wrote:   ""FYI - The toprope lanyards set up out here are run through a single rap ring attached by quick links and chains to two bolts. This is NOT REDUNDANT. Every single group of climbers I saw out there pulled up a rope with the lanyard and went to town TRing and lowering on the single rap ring.""   He also wrote: ""Walking around to the top isn't an option here,...""   I suspect with both this person and the OP that there is confusion in the overloaded term ""rap ring"". Unfortunately that term has been used to refer to the rolled, thin-walled aluminum rings, the newer beefy, forged, solid but still aluminum rings, and stainless or titanium anchor rings. The last can indeed be used as a TR anchor, esp. if attached with quick links to allow replacement when worn. Yes, as the commenter whines, if indeed there are single rings, they're not redundant, but they are also rated to something like 40kN.

112553036,"Mar 19, 2017",20 kN,"So I'll be on Oahu for a couple weeks at the end of March and want to do some climbing. I looked up Mokule'ia Wall and read that pull cords are already attached to the anchors so you can setup a top rope from the bottom, since the cliff top isn't too solid for walking around and setting them up. I found a picture and some comments saying that the anchor is just a single rap ring. Is that true? That's what the picture I found shows also. Is the rap ring stainless or something? The rap rings I'm familiar with around here are aluminum and would hardly stand up to the abuse of repeated top roping, so wondering if these are solid seeing they are the only thing keeping your rope up. I don't lead climb yet, so unfortunately can't climb it first and setup my own TR anchor off the bolts, otherwise that's what I'd do. With the exception of the 100% titanium anchors and a couple random other anchors, nearly every anchor at the Moke actually has two rings that you're top roping on. The titanium anchors only have one giant titanium ring as that's how they come from the factory, but that's the manufacturer-intended design and the anchor is certified for use in that configuration. The photo above is one example of the few stainless anchors remaining with a single ring and that's because that ring is a giant ring cut from 1/2"" stock that's rated to an in insane capacity and it's on a very popular route. Hawaii is a unique place in that climbers do regularly top rope directly on the anchors. That's been an accepted custom since long before I moved there. Anyway, as with anywhere, top roping on an anchor that you have not inspected yourself always carries risk regardless of how many rings there are and what they are made out of, but climbers do top rope directly on the anchor regularly at The Moke.

Are you staying in Hilo side or Kona side? If you are staying on Kona side and plan on going to the Volcano NP, I would get a cheap room in Hilo and stay there overnight - the drive from Kona side and then the drive through the park will drain you.   There is some incredible snorkeling on Big Island, I would plan on spending couple of days doing that. We found some off the beaten path spots that were incredible.
