Your point wasn't any worse than any of the others, but lined up behind the standpoint that one doesn't (always) have to hold the brake strand. Nobody cares what anyone else does while they are alone on a rope, e.g. developing. That situation is vastly different both morally and mechanically. The rope is likely static, the anchor is fixed, and you, the climber, won't surprise him or herself by suddenly unweighting and re-weighting a dynamic rope, unannounced.We agree that partners with a similar risk tolerance make a good pair. For most clever individuals risk tolerance will diminish over time.

There is a social psychologist and grounded theorist named Kathy Charmaz whose research is built on the impact that a new physical impairment has on one’s identity when physical things (like climbing) make up such a big part of one’s lifestyle and self-concept. I don’t know whether or not she has any books on the topic, but she definitely has a sizable body of research (mostly based in case studies) on this in the form of articles in scholarly journals; you can usually access these journals using your local library system’s credentials, or even alumni credentials through your alma mater.

Los Alamitos? Seal Beach? I've lost track. He had a cool scar on his chin from a fall in Joshua Tree and a great story about making up a different reason for that injury because he was afraid his coach would be pissed that he was climbing.    Rick went on to be a paramedic then firefighter then fire chief and Firegod in Redlands California and Park City, Utah. I think he was part of the preparations and security for the Winter Olympics in Park City. Not sure exactly what he's doing now. We should catch up with the people in our lives.    One of Rick's best friends, and one of the nicest humans I've known was a guy named Curt Minnis who was on the same football team I think. When I took my younger brother climbing to J Tree, Curt was as nice to him as anyone could ever be. Little bro Randy mentioned it for years. Curt has a great story about the high school coaches setting up a death marathon of lifting, running, field drills, obstacle course stuff, continuing endlessly until everyone dropped out and only one man was left standing. Rick and Curt were nauseaus with dread and competitive anticipation. The school principal learned of the event and canceled it.    Rick and Curt later climbed Half Dome Direct Northwest Face (not the Regular). So those are two football climbers I know. :) Rick and a smaller non football type named Quinn McCleod also did a bunch of El Cap Routes, not sure which all, but they include Lurking Fear and Muir Wall. Then they became Canadian Alpine climbers and I lost track of them... Quinn became a firefighter in Colorado. We climbed once or thrice here in Eldo.

Tracy and Gary, the owners and operators, are two of the nicest people you will ever meet.  They're originally native to Isla Vista (Santa Barbara) and I believe they were high school sweethearts from way back in the cool hippie surf days.  They're friendly and laid-back every day I've visited them and happy to provide local information; they never mind climbers calling for the weather (the most accurate report you'll get.) Their prices are fair and they stock everything you forgot to bring on your climbing trip and more, including chalk!  They have the books and maps of the region, gourmet State Street coffee, beer, toiletries, dry food, ice cream, camping supplies, firewood, gasoline, ICE, and much more!  It’s a really cool place to go see anyway; it has a dirt landing strip and a nice porch and the walls are covered with Tracy’s astronomy photos.  But what you absolutely must do is go sit at the homey little counter cafe in the back, enjoy the bottomless chips and incredible homemade salsa and have Gary serve you the infamous ""$100 cheeseburger.""  Several times, after a day of climbing in the Creek, I would’ve happily paid $100 for their delicious ½ pound, made to order, home-burger but alas, it’s only $8.95.  That’s recently gone up slightly but what, pray tell hath not?  And you get to beat the heat with interesting local people and conversation.  The burger tastes even better knowing that it’s the only burger for at least an hour in any direction.     Please note: Tracy and Gary have to truck in all their own water and truck out all the garbage.  There’s no free water or toilet or garbage drop-off, they just can’t accommodate everyone and when you get here you’ll understand why, they exemplify the meaning of DIY or “Do It Yourself.”    Needles Outpost - a beta photo from the internet.   canyonlandsneedlesoutpost.c…   BTW: I would say that scrounging for beer and maybe pizza left behind by droves of drive-through tourons on the Curry Village deck in Yosemite in the mid-90’s with all the other hungry scavengers competing in the wings (y’all know who you are) is a close personal second for me.

Then, my friends and I can top rope happily (some are not comfortable with lead belaying yet)Here is a picture of what I mean:Is this ok/normal?I always tie knots at the ends of the rope, use a prusik, and carry an extra prusik in case I need to ascend the rope (say, from missing the anchor)",3,Unknown Hometown,Jul 2018,0,,Top Rope set up standard practices,4.154471544715447,50.0,150,0.15,0.4125,not sexist,0.9981849789619446
