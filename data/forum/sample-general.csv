I would put 5.8 for a 5.6 that is widely recognized to go under the 'modern' 5.8 standard, with a note to the historical rating. I think a route should be rated according to a modern concensus regardless. Sure routes will get upgraded over time, but some also get downgraded. I don't think a rating system is something meant to be stagnant. It will change as the climbing community grows and the different styles and types of routes go up.    Eric Pohlman wrote:When in doubt, a little sandbag is better than a little fluff.This seems to be the concensus on how to grade routes, but it just seems to me that it would be better to fluff it and let the concensus drive it down. That way it is less likely for someone to get on something they can't handle, although I guess having to make the choice to either bail or grind through somehow is part of the experience.   (real off topic now)  It's interesting how historical ratings change, I just had a thought on why this happens. The YDS is technically supposed to grade according to sustained difficulty as I understand. And maybe if you have a 5.6 route that has a 5.9 move on it, it is still graded 5.6, maybe 5.7. Since that is what it is sustained at. Whatever ""5.9 move"" means... that's another story. Maybe that's why routes in Yosemite tend to be stiff(compared to most places, as I have heard), due to a more strict sustained grading system. One slighlty harder move is not enough to bump the grade up when the rest of the route is sustained at an easier grade. Where as many areas grade on the sustained nature of the climb sometimes and then according to the hardest crux move other times.   What is probably happening is that you get people climbing routes that are graded, say 5.10, but are really just sustained 5.9 moves with maybe an easy 5.10a/b crux. After getting used to this, one might get on a 5.10 eventually that is not as sustained but has a crux of similar difficulty. While the previous route was ""legitimate"" 5.10 due to its sustained nature, the new route might be 5.10a or 5.9/9+ since it is not sustained. This might lead to upgrading it to solid 5.10. And all this adds up over decades to a number grade difference eventually. So modern grades have been evolving towards a hardest move on the route system + the sustained'ness' of the climb, rather than just a 'pure' sustained grading system ('or' the hardest move). Ok...

Please help me understand why you and others view this as a weak, disrespectful thing to say.   Regarding Bachar-Yerian:  by my logic, NO, I wouldn't support retrobolting it because I have TWO criteria (already clearly stated twice in this thread) and B-Y only meets the first - the first criteria you understood (X-rated routes), the second was that the line had to be unique (meaning type of movement, rock quality) for the given area which, to my knowledge (and I've never climbed in Tuolumne), Bachar-Yerian is not - it is only unique in it's boldness (someone's probably going to correct me on this).  I also recognize that these two conditions for retrobolting are rarely (if ever) met for a particular locale; however, the OP brought this up as a purely hypothetical debate.    As another hypothetical:  what if someone did retrobolt B-Y so that it went from X to R-rated.  People could still climb it as an X-rated route if they chose.  I still believe that the desire to keep certain climbs X-rated is ultimately driven by ego.

118142725,2019-12-12,Dustin Helmer,"tl;dr at bottom for my simplified steps. This might not be the right place to post, but I'm hoping at least someone finds this interesting. This can all also be done in qgis, a free gis software, it's just harder.In the midst of procrastinating for finals, I wondered if it was possible to export the MP route/area map for Mt Lemmon to ArcGIS. The answer is yes, but not easily (there's definitely ways to make this process easier, just not within my current understanding).At the end, I want locations of every area with the number of routes and number of each type (trad, sport, TR) as well as the area names and elevation.First, I exported all the routes to .csv using the search function. Keep in mind that MP only returns 1,000 routes per search, which is a problem for Lemmon's 2,308 routes, so some copy/paste is needed to get it all into one .csv.The .csv file MP gives you looks a little like this:We've got Lat/Long and area, so we gucci. Go ahead and delete any columns not of interest for you (""your stars"", for me). I also had to delete duplicate routes due to the way I searched (because some routes are returned under trad and sport searches, etc).Now comes the tricky part. We want a count of the number of routes as well as the number of types (sport, trad, TR) in each area, as well as the lat/long of each area. I used some tricky countif functions in excel.First things first, I filtered/sorted by area so all routes of the same area are listed together. Then I used the formula =IF(B2=B1,"""",B2). Which returns the name of the area if it is the first time it is listed. Looked like this when finished:Now time for the countif functions. First things first I want the total number of routes for each area. I did this with the function =IF(L2=B2,(COUNTIF(B:B,L2)),""""). This function basically makes it only display if there is something in the first occurrence column, and counts the number of times that the route location=the first occurrence. The result looks like this:Now time for counting each type of route (sport, etc). The formulas are similar for each.Big hint here: Find and replace trad with ""td"" because searching for tr when counting top ropes returns trad and top ropes.The formula I used to count each type of route was =IF($K2=$B2,(COUNTIFS($B:$B,$K2,$E:$E,""*""&M$1&""*"")),""""). If you place your $ right, you can drag across for all route types. The result looked like this:(Sorry for the spreadsheet change)Sweet. We've got most of the info now, except the elevations.Now time to get rid of all the routes and route names and only extract the areas. There is definitely a more elegant way to do this than I did, but mine worked too. Basically what I did was select the rows which didn't have anything written in the ""first occurrence"" column and delete them. Unfortunately, selecting empty cells within a range using the go to special tool does not work because the empty cells in ""first occurrence"" aren't really ""empty"".Instead, I filtered and sorted A to Z for the ""first occurrence"" column and manually selected the empty rows and deleted them. I also deleted any columns which pertain to an individual route. The result looked like this:(Note: delete the spaces, arcgis hates spaces. Also I've sorted by total # routes.)Now I imported the .csv into argis and plotted the x-y data:and saved it to a shapefile. The result looked something like this:(note we care about the .shp note the .csv. Riight click on the .csv, data>export data, and save to .shp)Because I am going to spend a summer in Tuscon (the only reason I'm doing this), elevation of the crag was very important to me. To import elevation into the attribute table for crag locations in ArcGIS, we need a DEM raster layer and then extract values to points in arcgis.First I got a DEM from USGS, you can download the DEM I used for mt lemmon directly here. In ArcGIS looks something like this:Now to get the elevation from the dem and put it into the attribute table for the point data so we can make the points different colors based on elevation. For you newbies: to make sure ArcGIS doesn't throw errors, make sure background data processing is off and your extensions are enabled/checked. I used extract values to points (toolbox>spatial analyst tools>extraction>extract values to points):The attribute table for this new layer should have an ""elevation"" column (rastervalue, in my case):(note that the values are in meters. If you want them in feet, you can convert the DEM values to ft using the raster calculator and redoing the extract values, or doing some attribute table work.)Sweet, now we've got all the data in arcgis and can display is however we want. First things first, let's check out the elevation data by playing with the symbology:(note that the highest elevations in the DEM are white, same with the points so it looks like that worked.)Maybe I'm feeling spicy and want to find some trad routes:(made symbols bigger and played with the classification to exclude ares with no trad routes)I noticed that this isn't super helpful. Might need to play with the visualization a bit. Next I tried varying symbol size by number of routes:The possibilities are endless with this data set. Looking forward I might try to create a heatmap to show where the most climbs are. Or import a shapefile for the road and find which crags have the longest distance to the road (approach time), although distance to the road might not be the best representation of this. Also, the crag names are a bit messy, might want to clean that up a bit. Good luck, hope you found this at least interesting.TL;DR: 1. Extracted routes from MP by .csv,2.

I've been using a megajul on and off for years and I still rack it when climbing on skinny ropes with long approaches where I don't expect to rappel but it still surprises me from time to time. Some ropes work weirdly in it -- it's the only device on which I've slipped slack catching a lead fall and the only device I've ever almost dropped myself rappelling on. If the rope is too stiff or too soft it just doesn't work well and at this point I only bring it if I'm climbing on a rope I've tested it on and it works well. And rappelling on it in locking mode really can be that horrifying on some ropes ... sure you get lucky sometimes, but is that really what you want from a belay device?

Anyone who thinks they climb just as hard with +5 lbs on their waist has never tried. I think your perspective might be different with some actual trad climbs in your ticklist instead of just desert cracks where the rack is usually a precise given and a continuous TR possible if not the norm. Trad is ground-up on-sight adventure climbing with only your best estimate of what gear is needed. It's definitely not posing for Instaspray with 2 pcs left on your rack on a climb you have wired after dozens of practice laps. Desert cracks are only a small step up, IMO.Funny. If tick list are telling, you've never really climbed anything, of course your post is a troll or lack of experience (or likely a combo). My list has an extremely small % of my climbs and only some climbs to bookmark dates or routes. Been climbing since the early 90s. Most harder trad ascents were in the Black Canyon, Sandias, Cathedral NH, western MT, NRG, Gunks, Alps, etc, and not just desert cracks (although I sure do love them). I climbed > my tick list in pitches in the French Alps over the last 16 days....Your desert crack scenario isn't really accurate or possible in practice, if you are at or very near your limit, even though it is often attempted. If you are a 12- climber, attempting a 12-, and you try to bump gear and/or place so much you are on a near continuous TR, you WILL pump out and not send. You have to gun for it and often run it out to get it done. You can use this method on a 12- if you are >= 12+ climber and make it to the chains. The exception would be an OW that you can slot a knee and go hands-free. Some of my worst falls have been on thin desert cracks, where the rope is often flipping around your heels when above gear.Rope drag is almost always more of an issue than the extra rack weight. Unless the route is overhanging and has big gear, drag is way more important than the weight.Trad is a LOT more than onsight adventure climbing. Go to T-wall or the gunks and talk to the 12 and up climbers and tell those folks they aren't trad climbing and report back. If the OP said 12a trad onsight adventure climbing vs. 12a onsight sport, my stance would be quite different. I've only onsighted a modest number of 12 trad routes, compared to routes I have worked on or otherwise had beta for, and mostly with straight forward gear that you can get an idea of from the ground.Read the OP. Pretty sure they just want to lead a trad 12a or 2, probably with putting some work into it, and asking what that relates to in another sport (my opinion and experience is that its not much harder than a similarly graded sport route).

Every company makes money on their 80 dollar pants, 30 dollar t-shirts, and 30 dollar trucker hats now. And most climbers are wearing them, many crags are ugly-fashion shows.The idea that climbing companies are pushing climbers into gyms, etc. so that they can make boatloads of money of climbing gear is pretty unrealistic. Most of the big names are not making a very large profit on climbing gear. Rather, their big profits come from soft goods and clothing, and a lot that revenue doesn't even come from real climbers but just wealthy people who want nice stuff. And some of those profits are going back into R & D to make the climbing gear better. Because if they didn't they would lose their street cred with climbers which is usually contradicts their missions.If you wanna point the finger at companies making boatloads of money and having more money than anybody should, you wanna take a look at other sectors, such as finance, tech, oil and gas, etc. Metolius, DMM, WC, Trango, etc. are not making bank at the expense of climbers.

The other had also never rapelled before. The leader wasn't liking the look of p3 and was about to rap on his single 60m; the plan was to rap the plumb line 30m, hoping to make the ground, and then his partner, who'd never rapelled, would follow after him. They were both very very gripped. Rapping from there on a 60m would have been not good - 30m was going to leave their leader in the middle of the face - especially if they didn't have skills to reverse that mistake.My partner was gentle and kind and convinced them to let her lower them in turn, using their rope, which she then dropped to them.

107101571,2011-04-15,D F,"I feel like I have to say something, because I know Alex and have climbed with him, though it's been a while since we crossed paths. I also had a hobby of onsight free soloing for a few years when I was in my early 20s.   First thing to consider is how subjective the difficulty is in our sport. A 5.8 climber might think it's crazy to solo a 5.10 hand crack -- a 5.12 climber on the other hand, who has much more technique, strength and endurance, wouldn't be taking the same kind of risk that the 5.8 climber would. It's all perspective, and that might be the most important element for a soloist when he decides to leave the ground: What occurs in the mind makes a huge difference on any rock climb, especially for a soloist. (In my experience, the place that soloing took my mind and perspective was one of the most addicting aspects.)   I've watched Alex onsight more than one 5.13 in Rifle, including the 140-foot Eighth Day. That guy can hold on forever. He matches a crimp in the middle of a V5 crux halfway up, shakes out, looks around and calmly executes.    When a climber can control himself so well, that stacks more odds in his favor. Being able to pause, breathe, shake out and make smart choices in tough positions means that, in general, that guy can more safely solo some routes than another person with a rope and less poise and experience might.   It all boils down to our personal decisions, which are based on our own perspectives, eh? Someone might over-reach, but who are we to tell him what he can and can't do? I say, if a person's actions don't put me at risk, it's his or her choice.   That said, I do worry a little about Alex and have told him so, even as I admire his ability and like to imagine what other mind-blowing feats he is capable of.   If we didn't have people like Alex around, what might the limits of possibility seem like?",0,"Carbondale, CO",Jun 2007,6,"Access Fund Member, American Alpine Club Member",Outside Magazine Article on Honnold....Risk?,4.330459770114943,25.0625,401,0.1795378904249871,0.5327444956477215

124409862,2023-06-16,Adam Redfield,"Here's what I would recommend. Start early Sunday and get on The Yellow Spur to beat crowds. You'll go down the East Slabs descent and end up right by the base of Wind Tower. From here do either Wind Ridge (5.7-8 depending how you start) or Tagger (honest 5.10) depending on how you're feeling. Get to the top and then rap down. Short walk to the Bastille. Take your pick depending on crowds. Do Bastille Crack if it's open or doesn't look like too much of a shit-show (unlikely) and finish with Outer Space if you still have the juice and want maximum value. If Bastille Crack is packed, take either Werksup or you can wrap around to the West Face and get on Blind Faith or Sunset Blvd. Judging by your ticks this entire itinerary is well within your ability and would make for a very full-value introduction to the park. The beauty of Eldo is in it's layout which lends itself really well to linking climbs and doing a ton of pitches in a day where nothing really feels contrived.Here are some other linkups that would also be a ton of fun.Long John Wall (5.8) -> walk off back of West Ridge -> Green Spur (9+) -> Rewritten finish with Rebuffat's Arete (5.8) -> Gambit (5.8)Wind Ridge (5.7) -> bastille crack (5.8) -> Star Wars (5.8) -> Heavy Weather (5.9)Handcracker (10-) -> Yellow Spur (9+) -> Tagger (10) -> Outer Space (10)Rosy Crucifixition (hardest 10- i've ever done) -> Alice in Bucketland...it will get hot up there so start pretty early.

The only reason I have climbed along side my son was because it was his first time, and I knew he was going to get scared when he had to be lowered.  Another alternative I've heard of is to send the child up on top rope by themselves, but tie them into the middle of the rope (1/3 of rope length from the end actually).  The belayer has access to both strands as the kid is climbing.  That way, if he/she gets scared and you can't lower him, you can always tension his strand to force him down.  You can also keep tension on his strand to prevent a pendulum or keep him on route.    Just make sure your rope is long enough.  It will need to be 3x the height of the route.I'm loving all of the suggestions! In the end we just set up a top rope and let him go as far as he wanted and then lowered him when he was done. Easy.

I've been called ""arrogant"" for calling out a leader for not placing gear while simul-ing on Matthes while constantly trying to get between me and my partner (both traveling ropeless) with a very slow follower at the very back.

If you have narrow Sportiva feet, they may not.   Supermoccs:  I bought 'em big for thin crack.  In thin hands near your limit, these shoes will take off two letter grades.  No joke.

111142453,2015-10-16,Jay Bach,"I have kind of a cautionary tale here.    Last year I quit my desk job to become an EMT partly because I thought I'd have more time to climb (3 and 4 days weekends) and more flexibility. The reality has been complicated, and not what I imagined.    As someone mentioned earlier, after a 12 (or 13, or 14) hour shift it's hard to get it together and hit the gym. Factoring in travel time, when I was working 8a-8p it didn't even make seen for me to try to get to the gym becauseI'd barely have any time there. I also took a major financial hit switching to EMT, and while I knew that going in, the reality has been harder than I expected. I pick up overtime a lot which means I'm working 48 - 60 hours hours a week pretty often.    During the week, I do 30 - 60 minutes of hang boarding, kettle bells, etc. at home, and then get my ass in bed. Compared to when I worked a standard 9-5, I'm working out less and my fitness has been pretty stagnant. That said, I did a bunch of great 3 day trips this summer that were only possible because of my job.    If I want to advance and become a paramedic, nurse, PA, etc. so I can start making a living wage, I'll have to take a lot of classes, and that means climbing even less for at least a couple years.    With my old job, I was able to travel for work and tack on a day or two of climbing at the end, I had plenty of time during the week to get fit, and I had an income that let me travel wherever I wanted when I had time off.

108266778,2013-08-20,J. Albers,"FYI, I also posted the text below on the actual Archangel page in the hope that it will heighten the chance that Mr. Weidner sees and takes into account all of the support he has before considering what to do about the bolts.   Before commencing with my useless drivel below, I wanted to make two things clear. First, I don't know Mr. Weidner or any of his friends, so I really don't have a dog in this fight other than the future of the route. And second, what I write below is not meant to offend Mr. Byrne or to take anything away from his initial experiences with this route.    A few weeks ago I went up to climb Archangel to both check out the route and to see if this thing might actually be a reasonable, ground up lead on gear. I brought all of my HB brass and cams down to a black Alien and below is my take on the route.    First of all, this route is awesome and I have to give credit to Mr. Byrne for scoping the line and putting in the initial effort to send it. In particular, the transition from liebacking the edge of the arete to the stance below the roof is classic. That said, I don't believe that this route was ever ""sent"" (at least not using any traditional metric of what it means to send a route). When I got to the anchor that Mr. Weidner installed, I stepped out right onto the climbing where the route was originally intended to proceed (i.e. to the location that Mr. Byrne placed his anchor). Upon doing so, I feel that it is safe to say that Mr. Weidner's assessment of the grade to Mr. Byrne's original anchor is correct, say something in the 13c/d range. This leads one to the obvious conclusion: Mr. Byrne intended to finish up at his anchor, but couldn't, so he lowered off of a fixed pin just before the crack peters out near the end of the undercling section. So what does that mean? That means that Mr. Byrne spent 2-3 months toprope wiring a route and installing some sparse fixed gear. He then led it to the point that he could climb no further and then lowered off. I can't understand how this in any way constitutes a sent route. Moreover, even if one could argue that lowering off of a fixed pin part of the way up a route counts as FA'ing the route, there is still the issue of how this route was put up.    First of all this route was put up top down. Now this of course is just fine, but it clearly negates any argument that folks like Mr. Long have made regarding respecting ""ballsy"" ground up ascents. I think that virtually anyone with a shred of grey matter would concede that wiring a route on toprope and then installing fixed gear that is utterly inadequate for a ground up ascent is simply not a style of climbing that is common nor accepted amongst a huge majority of the community. So that leads me to address climbing this thing ground up with gear and/or some of the fixed protection.    Beginning at the ledge after the first 30 feet of climbing, here is what you can place using clean gear. At the first bolt you can slot a couple of small to medium sized brass HB's off to the left. They would lead to a less pleasant fall than the bolt, but you would be okay. At the second bolt - where you really need protection to keep you from breaking your ankles on the ledge - you would have to be a fool to place anything behind that rotten rock (I tried to get a black Alien just to check, but couldn't get it in...the crack is just too small). And this is after Mr. Weidner cleaned out the worst loose rock out of this section. I sort of shudder to think of what was there before because as it is now, I was trying to minimize how hard I pulled on the flake getting past the second bolt. A bolt or two beyond, you can again get a couple pieces of gear (medium sized nut and a red Camalot), though the two pieces of gear are close enough to each other that it would really only eliminate one bolt at best. After that, there is no more gear until after you pull the crux roof, at which point you may be able to get a couple of marginal micro cams in the flared undercling crack.    So what does this all mean? It means that if the bolts on this thing get removed, the route will become a 12c R/X route that nobody ever climbs. The proof that this is the case is the simple fact this route has not seen a single ascent since it was toproped 25 years ago. And what about doing it the style of the first toprope runs? I guess that means that you need to rap in and toprope the route until you are comfortable soloing it. You then clip the runout gear, which is largely irrelevant at this point because you have it so wired you can solo it. The climbing community actually has a word for doing a route in this style. Its called contrived. Contrived as in, you purposely made the route dangerous with fixed protection despite the fact that you could have done so differently. If you are doing it ground up and placing bolts at the stances, then fine, you did what you could. But installing R/X on rappel? Contrived. And no, this doesn't count as a headpoint because bolts were installed. If Mr. Byrne wanted to headpoint it, he would get the two brass nuts at the start, the red Camalot 10 feet higher, and then perhaps a marginal micro cam to lower off of at the end. What that means is that unless you can onsight solo 12c, you are going to either get totally f*cked up or die trying to do this route ground up. Sh*t, given the suspect nature of the potential flared microcam placements at the ""end"" of the route, you better also be comfortable down-soloing this thing because if those cams pull while lowering, you are definitely gonna be a sack of slush after you hit the ground. Does that sound like anything other than a stupidly protected X-rated route? And this is what Mr. Long and the armchair SuperTaco crowd are mounting a heated defense over?    In conclusion, I think that it is pretty clear that the bolts should stay. Or at a minimum, all of the bolts minus the two gear placements should stay. And I don't think that I am anywhere close to the only one who thinks this. And to all of the folks above who called Mr. Weidner a punter etc., how do you explain the words of support that the local crowd has expressed in Mr. Weidner's defense? Contrary to your chest pounding rants, some of us who are defending the bolts are not the punters that you would make us out to be. How about you look into the background of some of the people you are talking down to before you spout off so strongly. Go take a look at the names here and on the Archangel forum thread (see here: mountainproject.com/v/archa…) that are supporting Mr. Weidner: Ted Lanzano, Tank Evans, Pinklebear, Blake Herrington to name but a few...these are not exactly the wanker sportos that your misplaced rants are intended for now are they?

I agree that a good lesson to learn from your experiences is to have the rope through a piece (any piece) above you. It lowers the fall factor, and certainly getting pulled upward introduces a dynamic aspect to the belay that isn't going to be there if you catch the fall hanging from the belay anchor (but I'll bet being tied in with the rope helps there).   It appears that the falls which you caught, although likely very high fall factors, were significantly less severe than the worst case scenarios that the Germans were testing. Basically, they did relatively low factor drop tests (0.4) directly onto a completely static belay using a ""simulated hand"" that applied a braking force to the rope based on empirically-measured forces that humans are able to apply.   No device other than a GriGri was able to stop the fall without significant slippage (even the GriGri slipped 8cm; the tube devices all slipped a meter or more at the low end of the force range humans can apply). Interesting enough, a munter belay proved better than all devices other than the GriGri.   Actually, I'm a bit surprised that they found so much slippage at such a low fall factor, particularly in light of your experiences.   If you can read German, two reports are found here and here.   In addition, Jim Titt has reported some interesting testing results (in English) here (search for ""belay device"" on the page as there is no link to the section on belay devices).

If I were to name the most important element for me as a 'climber over 50', it would have to be hormones, hands down. Without estrogen (HRT-Hormone Replacement Therapy), I simply wouldn't be climbing. I wouldn't want to. I know because I've been on both sides of this fence and experienced the dramatic changes in mind and body with tiny amounts of hormone. Because human hormones are so critical to all aspects of our being, I think it's worth discussing in this forward-thinking group now and then. There is such a fear of cancer (nod to Hillbilly Hijinks). The first thing my doctor said when I sat down in his office (actually, he's said it many times) was ""I'll bet you are worried this causes cancer."" As usual, he loaded me up with current studies showing that bioidentical hormones do not cause cancer. If labwork of estrodial, testosterone, SHBG, HGH, FSH and LH and all the rest identifies levels far below normal, the critical ones can be safely raised to within range--not higher. If you are still making plenty of sex hormones, then no need to add anything. But if your tank is dry... adding small physiologically appropriate levels of natural (bioidentical) hormones can save a life, not take it.I didn't expect to be the hormone advocate here--and I'm no poster child. I don't talk to anyone about this in my own circle of family and friends. But it's one of those things I feel so strongly about, in terms of well-being (and ability to climb). In 2002 the Women's Health Initiative found that post-menopausal women taking combination (estrogen and progestin) hormone therapy for menopause symptoms had an increased risk for breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and urinary incontinence. Overnight, millions of women ceased taking estrogen, including my mother and sister and 3 of my friends. They also turned old, overnight. Especially for my sister and mother, all the problems began... including bladder and vaginal problems, depression, rapidly aging skin and falling out hair. Nevertheless, they soldiered on, fearing cancer. The problem was, the WHI was deeply flawed. So, my experience has been that in order to avoid 'cancer' and stroke and the myriad other things supposedly credited to estrogen (mare's urine, not estradiol beta 17), the medical establishment swapped estrogen for depression, insomnia, high cholesterol, bone loss, total loss of sex drive, vaginal atrophy, obesity cardiovascular disease... etc. It's absolutely normal to leave a medical office (like Kaiser) with a prescription for a statin, antidepressant, anti-hypertensive, incontinence drugs -- it's expected in menopausal women.It's only recently that we have been able to live this long, and I think medicine has not yet caught up. There's lots of metrics for 30 year olds, very few for 60+.

108881955,2015-05-15,cragmantoo,"I think the original point of this thread was to discuss if leaving a domestic dog alone in a public wilderness area is unsafe for or unkind to the dog.   It's really not about whether climbers like dogs, if climbers like others telling them what to do (or not do) or any of the other offshoots from the OP.   I personally think it is unwise to leave a dog alone under those circumstances. My labrador is perfectly at home in the woods but I would not leave him unattended. While everything would likely be fine, much can happen. The dog can confront other dogs, who may not be friendly, wildlife, unstable 2 legged creatures, rock fall or might just wander off & have difficulty getting back. Dogs are not wild animals and have been bred to depend on humans in some vital ways (food for example) that wild animals/wolves do not.

Revo looked interesting, but if it struggles paying out slack, then it's a no go.Like most belay devices, the Revo feed is a little rope-diameter dependent. Still, I suspect it is great for paying out slack for the diameters of most gym ropes used today.The Revo spec say it's good to up to 11 mm. But a couple of my belayers struggled (tiresomely) to feed with a 10.4 mm rope. Perhaps there is also a biner dependency mixed in in that upper range?My partner and I now use a 10.2 mm rope with the Revo and it works great. I believe any lead rope below that diameter will feed well; though stiffer ropes could still be difficult. Perhaps others here have opinions on that.I did find one issue with feeding for lead belays. Fast brake-hand movements tend to also be exaggerated in their arc. So, initially, my brake hand would sometimes knock an ""ear"" of the Revo upward and cause it to lock. Not fun for the leader trying to clip. But I've trained myself to keep my hands farther away from the Revo. And feeding has not been a problem since.I have no real experience with the mammut alpine smart to convey, sorry.Edit: My partner and I do use belay gloves with the Revo.

(Read about it here  if interested)     Hopefully using the information from your course to think about what you would want if a certain accident were to happen. The questions of, what is most likely to occur, and what to carry are both common ones. Here's perhaps a longer answer than you want, but I'm currently stuck in bed rest so here it goes...   I carry different mid-kits based on the activity/season. I'll start with my barebones kit, which I carry when I'm climbing with trusted, trained partners and hoping to go light/fast. It includes:   - non-latex gloves   - 2 5x9 (ABD) Gauze pad  -1 Roller Gauze or ACE bandage   - 1 Cravat   - 4 x 81mg Aspirin (This is the dose for Cardiac/chest pain and is also a painkiller & NSAID)   - 2/3 Band-aids   - 1 Antiseptic    Other things that always come with me to supplement the ""med-kit"" include, a ski strap, headlamp, extra layer (e-blanket in summer), water and food. Again, this is the barebones kit. This is what I was carrying with my during the accident listed above.    My larger med-kit, which comes with me when I am going on longer, more remote climbs, overnights, places without cell service, when I'm guiding/instructing, or cragging includes:   Bleeding Control Bag:  - Non-latex gloves  - 2 5x9 (ABD) Gauze pad  - 2 4x4 Gauze Pad's  -1 Roller Gauze or ACE bandageSplinting:  -1 SAM Split  -2 Cravats  -1 Medical Tape    Routine Care Bag:  -5 Regular Bandaids  -2 Butterfly Bandaids (Great for flappers)  -2 Knee Bandaids (Great for, you guessed it, skinned knees)  -Tweezers   -Small Trauma Shears    Meds:  - Aspirin (see notes above)  - Anti-Diaherrea   - Anti-Nausea   - Anti-Histamine   - Benadryl    - Maple Sugar Packet (supplment for oral glucose)   Other:  Headlamp  Mega warmer packet  E-Blanket   Rite in the rain notebook pages  Pencils   Cell phone with NOLS SOAP Note appFeel free to reach out with questions. Remember that these aren't set in stone bags, and what you chose to carry is based on your own criteria of safety and comfort. Many people will carry less, many more. Many will always have as much as I listed in bag 2. Use the skills from your course to evaluate what is best.    And for building your kit, I recommend ordering a kit or bag from someone like adventure medical. Then add or remove things as needed. It's important to have a well labeled bag so others can find it, and waterproof is a big bonus. Most pre-made bags come over stuffed with things like band-aids etc. that you can remove, and add the things you really need like cravats, that often never come in these kits.",2,Colorado,Jan 2014,8,American Alpine Club Member,Medical/ First Aid Kit,4.678879310344827,27.15,543,0.2313605442176871,0.4347148090005233

My point was grades aren't consistent. Go climb at Planet Granite in SF then go climb at Mission Cliffs SF and tell me a 5.10 at one gym = a 5.10 at the other. Because it doesn't.   Go climb something like Solar Power at The Bubble on Mt. St. Helena, which is rated 5.10d in the guide books. To me, and to my friends, it feels like a 5.9—maybe a 5.10a— in the gym. And that's no exaggeration this time. Everyone's different. So some climbs are easier to certain people. And some are harder. ""Mystery Hole"" at Far Side on St. Helena was super easy to me.

This isn't a point.Again, if you compare bolts of an unknown quality to cams of a known quality you can say whatever you want. That doesn't change the fact that there are people placing very high quality bolts, and those bolts are far safer than any cam.I dunno, why don't you ask some of the folks on this forum that are replacing bolts? This isn't the boogeyman you're making it out to be, it's a problem with a fairly well-understood solution.No it's not: if you're okay with bolting a rock face then it's absolutely no less sustainable to bolt the crack next to it.Further, sustainability often involves compromise. In some cases, the alternative to bolting an area to make it accessible to more climbers might be that the land doesn't see enough recreational use and gets redesignated for mining or housing.Absolutely. The fact that you think this disagrees with what I've been saying is proof that you haven't taken the time to understand what I've been saying. I'm not saying bolt everything. I'm not even saying anything should be bolted.Don't talk down to people you don't know anything about--it weakens your point. I may not be the climber you are, but I've hiked plenty of the US's wildest areas and I'm well aware what's at stake.I don't want bolts. It's easy to shoot down what you're pretending I've said. It would be much harder for you to respond to what I've actually said.You want to preserve places that are beautiful and natural. There's nothing wrong with wanting that, I want that too. The question is, how do we get what we want? I don't think making false claims about the safety/modernity of gear or pretending you have some moral authority that nobody else has is the way.You don't know what you are talking about, David. I give no shits that you think you are being talked down to because you are, for posting nonsense.I am one of the people that replaces bolts and I work with Greg Barnes at the ASCA on rebolting projects. I know precisely what I am talking about. The vast majority of bolts still out there in the USA are some form of shitty galvanized carbon steel and are time bombs (even if they are SS). No one (other than the person who just placed a quality SS bolt) can look at a bolt from outside the hole and know for sure its a ""good bolt"" in there with the same certainty that you can a good cam placement. Its a fact that for everyone else everything under that hanger is a mystery that is blindly trusted that increases in danger with time. Whereas every cam placement can be totally assessed by the climber and the cams themselves are virtually always trustworthy from a manufacturing stand point.Do not blindly trust any bolt you did not just place yourself unless you must. This goes for ANY bolt. A bomber cam is better than any bolt because it is a fresh placement with reliable equipment every time that can then havejudgment applied as to its integrity. Not so with bolts in that (all of them) become more and more dangerous in time and you have no idea if the job was done right to begin with by the bolt maker or guy placing it.If you had any experience placing and removing bolts (or placing cams for that matter) you would know this. Batches of bolts from the non-climbing makers are routinely garbage. Not so with climbing specific gear. Commercial construction bolts (the vast majority used) would routinely fail QC for lacking proper alloying or hardening etc etc if they were ever tested at all.... Every bolter with experience has placed a bolt that he then realizes is absolute garbage because something about the manufacturing wasn't done right and then had to throw out the entire rest of the box, wondering about the others he placed...but in a horrible predicament as to what to do about it. Were the others bad too or was it just one? Your life actually really does depend on stuff like this if you clip bolts others placed.This in addition to hidden corrosion that is totally unpredictable yet people then blindly trust them knowing nothing of this reality. When you replace bolts you commonly find ones that look rusty shitty that turn out to be incredibly bomber, and ones that look good that are incredibly shitty inside. Like come to jeebus say your prayers shitty.Bolting of deserving face climbs is a necessary evil for rock climbing as we know it. Bolting of good cracks is an abortion of rock climbing and contrary to any sort of ethic of wildness or minimal impact. When rare (at or on an otherwise nearly all bolt protected area or pitch) it is not a totally unreasonable convenience to get the pitch climbed and open some eyes to crack/mixed climbing, imo. There is some line to cross for the crack route when adding bolts so it ""gets climbed a little"" vs ""none at all"" that justifies it, imo, but only someone like me or others with 40 years of new routing (with the attendant success and mistakes) is informed enough to judge.Not people like you that still shit post on this forum asking for newbie advice and are just making things up as you go and barf them on the internet.And this idea that bolting a crack or not is just a ""matter of taste"" is one of the more offensive things I have ever seen an adult that pretends to care about the natural world and rock climbing ever post. It can only be done with a profound ignorance of all that is involved. The safest long term and sustainable protection solution in good crack is using natural protection.Have a nice day.ps Honestly David, I am being mean to make a point.

Also, if you're rappelling on a single strand (e.g. simul-rapping) you might want to double up on carabiners to add a bit more friction. Other than that, things should handle pretty much the same with your ATC guide.   When building anchors with the rope, a single half rope is plenty strong enough. You can build the anchor with just one rope, or you can use both ropes in various combinations. There are lots of options, and you just need to figure out what works best for you.   As far as self-rescue, the only thing that comes to mind is that it's rougher on your hands when pulling on a skinny rope in a haul system.

I could haul gear and perhaps be an improvised chock in an off width crack maybe. heheh   I am planning on climbing down there in January with my sons (15 and 9). We are planning to camp at the prison camp one weekend. By the way I finally sprung for a real climbing rope.   Two questions, first when you say take your chances the anchor will hold one more load are you refering to the last rap?    Second when you say the two-bolt anchors arent holding much weight it seems a little confusing if after the lead climber lowers and cleans the draws, then the other clibers are totally on the top anchor, which is why I was curious about climbs that dont have those nice two-bolt anchors you guys are putting up down there. The specific climb I'm thinking about is up here at Camelback, its the Headwall route. The descriptions dont indicate whether there is a two-bolt at the top. Your suggestion to leave the next to last piece in sounds good as long as its cool to rap off of that last bolt, which sounds fine to me if that is how it is done.

Didn't know this was all going on. I wonder how many of you have become more utilitarian and extremely conscious of time as I have? There's a lot of selection that goes on in our lives... what's useful, what gets us to our goals, and what is pointless. I'm increasingly aware of that hourglass... the to-do list is long, not a lot of time for distractions. Along those lines, I have a fresh wave of understanding that this COVID thing has changed how we live, probably forever. I've been in a kind of holding pattern, waiting it out. Our gyms closed again. All the stores have (mostly) gone on-line. But looking back since February, I've been making do, and waiting for some kind of normal to return.Now it suddenly seems like, instead of waiting it out, it's time to create the new life and new routines out of the options present... no bullshit, no more waiting around. And it's a great time to get rid of whatever doesn't work (looks like Nick is contemplating that, too.) Senor was kind enough to introduce me to a friend of his who is/was a dancer and is now a climber. I don't love yoga, but I was passionate about dance and nothing does a body like structured dance (ballet/jazz even hip hop). New York City Ballet has a great workout on Netflix (I believe). Someone here posted some other ballet workouts back in March, I think? Someone (maybe Chris) is going to help me make my Josh garage livable, make it a workout place I can go into every day and really want to be there. If the garage won't work, I'll just have to move it into our dining area. Weights, rings, hangboard...whatever else. It's just time to do it, and do it right. So, what are you all doing to get off the waiting treadmill?There's really no time for crap, or useless excuses, or pointless negativity. And for us, the consequences are high for wasting time. Tony had to go for an EKG yesterday, prior to scheduling his big surgery. it looks like he may have had a heart attack at some point, for sure his heart is not strong... and he's kicking himself for years of neglect.

We parked and started hiking before, at a good pace and no breaks, while they were putting gear in their bags. We got to the base of the climb about a minute after partner #1 who immediately laid out his gear at the base. When jokingly asked if he ran to the base he said he jogged, we said he snaked the climb he didn’t respond.

It’s clear that you are so sidetracked by the numbers that you miss the entire lesson. The failure rate was just an example used to answer the OPs original question in very simple terms that are easy to do the math and easy for non-math minded people to understand. I wasn’t in any way trying to justify the numbers, but I’ll get back to that. Here is how simple it is to understand if you can put aside the numbers for a second (I know it’s difficult because you feel the need to be so right but just humor me for a second).Suggest there is a 1 in 50 chance of failure of any one piece of failing in an anchor:A one piece anchor then would a 2%chance of failure.A 2 piece anchor would then have a 0.04% chance of failure.And a 3 piece anchor would have a 0.0008% chance of failure.Most sane people would not be comfortable with 2%.Some people would be comfortable with 0.04%.But most would feel completely comfortable with 0.0008% which is essentiallyzero.I have witnessed a 2 piece “bomber” anchor fail (and the leader originally had 3 pieces but took one out to use higher on the route). That person fell over 100ft and broke their neck.  Luckily they knocked their partner out when they fell on her and she surprisingly didnt fall with him. And he surprisingly survived.So in this case 1 out of 50 was a bigoverestimation.Probability vs consequencesNow back to the supposition of using 1 out of 50 as an example.This number was just being used as an example but I still think its a reasonable number for the community of climbers with various levels of experience/competenc3 placing gear.For a new leader 1 in 50 is pretty optimistic. I have followed new leaders where most of the gear they placed would likely not hold a fall. I’ve even climbed with “ experienced” leaders who I would not fall on 8 out of 10 pieces. But as for myself and my frequent climbing partners who have much more experience and are more meticulous placing gear I think 1 in 50 still seems realistic. And I have probably placed 50,000 pieces of pro over the years and have been teaching trad gear placement skills for over a decade. But I havent fallen on all those pieces of pro so I’ll never know ( which is actually the only way we can really know). Nobody can see every little nuance inside a dark crack. Bad rock, grit/sand, loose crystals, etc etc. Many people dont really adequately test their placements either (a tug generates nowhere close to the force of a fall). And many people blindly trust cams without really understanding the physics of how they work and that they rely 100% on friction to work. Maybe you are better than that. Maybe you just think you are.And yes. None of us know x and y. So to explain basic probability it’s simple and easier to understand if we use easy to multiply numbers that make the math easy than to use variables. But feel free to continue to get stuck on and argue the numbers and miss the entire concept. In addition to the probabilities being completely arbitrary and probably bogus, this kind of thing also assumes that the failure of each piece is entirely independent of the failure of other pieces. This is very rarely the case. Rather, with the exception of small gear and pieces one already knows to be bad, I would guess that if one piece fails then there's a good chance all would fail.If a piece fails that was thought to be ""bomber"", it probably did so because of poor rock quality, which may compromise your other pieces, or because the person assessing that piece was incompetent and all the pieces are suspect.",1,"Durango, CO",May 2014,5,Access Fund Member,Minimum Number of Pieces for a Trad Anchor?,4.544227886056971,28.807692307692307,749,0.1073153216646367,0.5097160830037542

(aikibujin, kablauch Blauch).For the record, that was said in jest. If I need to lower my second in guide mode, I use method E (basically defeating the auto-block device completely and lower with a munter hitch), which I learned because I had a Trango B-52 belay device and that's the method you'd use with it (B-52 does not have a hole to thread slings). With this method, I don't need to have a skinny sling or pre-thread the little hole with cord, I can use a big fat 18mm sling (or even the rope on my end), and I can easily set up mechanical advantage if I need to.And I think one of us is not understanding Andy Hansen correctly. I thought he was talking about a load-strand re direct, which is the same method laid out by kablauch and now N Nelsen below. I think that is different from the D.1 method you laid out, because you don't flip the device at all, you leave the device in the same configuration, but change the direction of the load strand of the rope by re-directing it through the master point. This has the benefit of better control of the lowering without needing a backup (it may still be a good idea to use one).

If I were to cut a new trail through the woods in Yosemite there would be mobs coming for me on the internet and possibly IRL, and justifiably so, but there are a few designated hiking trails trough the wilderness that people use with the blessing of the national park service and the consensus of the overwhelming majority of wilderness users. Why can't occasional bolts be thought of as ""trails"" but for climbers? The Mist Trail exists, so why can't the (tastefully few) bolts on Snake Dike? If someone wants to add a route in such an area, they would need permission from relevant authorities which would judge the merit of the proposal.In environmentally sensitive areas, bolt installation can be strictly monitored and limited either by land managers, climbers' coalitions, etc. This would allow people to climb Half Dome without having to free solo it while still preventing people from putting an ugly bolt ladder into any old rock face. This would bring climbing into line with other user groups, such as hikers (trails) or boaters (designated boat launches/docks) that also recreate in the wilderness and alter the landscape, but in a very controlled way. I agree with you that ending this imbalance is likely necessary in the long term as the current laissez faire situation will probably not be indefinitely sustainable, as should be the goal. The problem is that even when an area seems to be climbed out, with no rules someone will always try to squeeze in a new line to claim an FA. A bit of reasonable regulation could stop this while allowing climbing to broadly continue (to a large extent indignant climbers with crowbars already do this in a lot of areas).Rules can be very restrictive, to the point of full bolt bans, in environmentally sensitive areas and fairly lax in areas that already aren't very wild and where adding some bolts wouldn't dramatically alter their character, like a city park.I like some of what your saying but snake dike could easily be climbed without the few bolts and are there not other routes to the top of half dome that are mostly if not completely bolt free? so little overkill to say you would have to free solo it AKA= Honold Also I am for getting rid of the backside cables. I know it brings the summit of half dome to a mass of the population that otherwise would not but my view is if you cannot or will not make a little effort at achieving something then just go to a summit without having any technical climbing.

Another method I often use is to clip in to the master point, proceed to the edge (you can stay on belay for this, or, like you said, lower yourself) then tie a BHK (overhand on both starnds) about arm's length above you (toward the anchor). Now you're tied-off and can do a rope direct belay off this extended masterpoint with a Grigri or autoblocking device.To give a really good belay, it's important to have a visual on your second. That way, as they make a move, you're right there with them, taking in the slack smoothly, and they're not getting slapped with the rope in their face, or looking at too much slack at an inopportune time.Dallas, I know this sounds confusing, but it's actually fairly simple to rig.

Journalism does that, and does it well.Once Outside got hold of all these mags, the MO was to promote (sell) their brand, the purpose of which was not to produce meaningful stories, rather to generate ad income. In this model, an article is worthy so long as it doubles as click bait. So while the ""old"" model used to seek solid stories, the new ad-driven model will print anything that generates ad dollars. Watch how in a few months, the blurbs in Climbing will take on the aspect of Twitter refrains.The first casualty here is evergreen stories, the stuff you can read in 30 years and still know it's the real stuff. Those stories cost money to generate, require experts to write, and a lot of time to produce.So what you end up with are people who fire expensive experts like Matt, swap our narrative writing with disposable blog-style stuff, and call it good.As I mentioned elsewhere, Surfer's Journal has taken the opposite track and done well with it.

111054099,2015-09-21,JCM,"A few thoughts:   -Overall, it looks like a damn good itinerary.  You go to each area at about the right time (although mid-winter is hard), have a sensible and efficient driving plan, visit an appropirate number of places, and spend an appropriate amount of time at each place.  Trying to rush to ""see it all"" can ruin a trip, and having to leave out good destinations is inevitable (see the comments above).  That is OK.   -Again, ignore comments about ""But you MUST stop at XYZ"".  Usually the people saying that have limited road trip experience and are just touting their local/favorite area.  Any well-planned road trip will have you driving past several dozen worthy crags on the way to the places you really want to go.   -Don't be married to your schedule.  Flexibility is king.  If the weather sucks or you get bored, bail and go somewhere else.   -More that 3 weeks, if possible, in Squamish.  Maybe do the drive north a bit quicker to increase Squamish time.  The variety in the climbing there is outstanding, so it will keep you busy for a while.  Plus the hangout is great. Squamish weather is reliably good in July/August, especially the last few years.  If anything, it might be hot.   -3 weeks may or may not be too much in Tensleep.  Depends on how much you like it.  When I've gone, I've gotten tired of vertical crimping after two weeks.  You may stay psyched for the full three weeks though.  I'd say budget 3 weeks.  If you like it, stay the whle time.  If you get tired of it, bail a week early and stop at Devils Tower and/or the Needles on the way eastward.   -3 weeks may be too much time at the Gunks. The climbing there is great, but isn't the most varied--pretty much all the climbs fit the same theme. 2 weeks should be enough to get you fill (but I may be wrong here). I think that extra may be better spent having more time for the New/Red. You can always budget 3 weeks for the gunks and bail to the New early if you feel like it.   -Winter is hard.  Even places like Cochise, Red Rocks, and J-Tree can be brutally cold and windy in Dec-Feb. I would reccomend going to El Potrero Chico for the deepest/darkest part of the winter.  It will be much warmer, more reliably nice weather, and the climbing is fun.  Super cheap.  Despite the news reports, it is safe to go there as a climber.

110840412,2015-08-03,m russi,"It sounds like he was tied in short – the locking biner being his back-up knot, and the sliding knot being either a friction hitch or a clove hitch on the lead line.  Usually when people do this, it's to simul-climb or self-belay.   It is possible to self-belay while having your second(s) ""on belay"": you build an anchor, pull up the slack in the line until your second(s) come(s) tight, and fix the portion of the line running to your seconds so that they can put an ascension or self-belay rig on their side of the line and climb/jug without your involvement. Then, you continue leading past the anchor, belaying yourself through your short tie-in, as your second(s) approach the anchor through free-climbing or jugging.  During the period of time after the rope has been fixed, all members of the party make upward progress.   This is short-fixing and it's a technique developed by big-wall speed climbers.  It's usually used on big routes that require sections of aid climbing.  It is easier to self-belay when you're aiding, since you can make use of both hands at the same time to manage the system.  To self-belay while free climbing, you have to use a device like a Grigri or Soloist, because it's a huge pain in the ass to manipulate friction hitches/clove hitches when you're only held to the wall by your own hands and feet.   I guess they could have been simul-climbing but I've never heard of it being done with two seconds.  Honestly, the whole situation makes little sense to me.  P.s., you can stay in direct to that eyebolt while your partner rappels - you girth hitch a sling to the bolt and clip it with a locker to your belay loop.  The sling occupies a small enough portion of the cross-sectional area of the bolt to permit threading a rope.

There are other incorrect items too, but I doubt that the MP community is really interested in all of it at this point.  I suppose some creative writer could turn  this into some kind of TV show like drama for the magazines, that would sure be a different than the usual we climbed this really gnarly route sort of article. There are numerous mistatements, aren't there Tod? That's why I finally posted - to clear those up. I was trying to be the bigger person and keep the issue between us but clearly that was naive of me. You wanted a public hearing and so, here it is. With that said, thank you for not denying all those other shameful things, including trying to create a false lawsuit against me or choreographing this forum thread. As for the comment about the $10,000? Well that's from your first response to when I initially reached out to you (as a friend, ha!) about this whole thing. I'll cut you some slack since that was years ago and your memory may be unclear, but I can show you where you said that if you need refreshing. You asked if I was personally going to pay you for all the bolts you put in which was at least $10,000.    Anyway, the real reason I'm posting again is that I wanted to thank everyone that has emailed me today with their support as well as personal apologies from so many of the DH Crew. Please, don't post up here, hopefully we can just let this issue die now. I just wanted to say thanks and I will respond to all of you, but there was  a lot, so please give me some time. To all that asked for a beer, I truly meant that - I'd be more than happy to clear the air with you. Also, thank you to those that don't necessarily outright believe me or Tod, but looked at both sides of the story and had the mental capacity to reach their own conclusions about the issue. I hope people look at this and think to contact me (or anyone else they want to jump on a bashing banwagon for) before they go all attack happy on the Internet.

It’s an ok place to live and you can climb real rock after work as long as you get off at a reasonable time.  Boldering 10 min drive from down town.  Single pitch 20-30 min drive, 20-30 min hike.  Multi pitch 20-30 min drive 45-60 min hike.  Other then climbing we have world class mountain bike riding in Fuita and Moab, the local ski resort is reasonably priced around $50 a lift ticket, year round kayaking/rafting at every level, and the hiking/mountaineering is good.Crowds?  No crowds really, a couple popular routes can get a line but you can go around the corner and it’s all good.  Indian Creek, Moab, Riffle, and Ouray Ice Park are world famous and can get crowded.  Locals complain about traffic but we’re from LA so we just laugh at them.  And no matter where you are in town you can be in the middle of nowhere in about 30 min.Rock/Route quality? Depending on where you go we have everything from complete crap to really good.  The local Monument has some of the worst rock quality and can scare the crap out of you quite a bit but there are some really good routes in there and if you stick to the popular routes they’re clean.  Unaweep is good hard old granite and can be slick but some of the best climbing around.  Ouray has great ice climbing in the winter and good rock climbing the rest of the year.  My wife doesn’t like the quantity of easier routes around though.  If you climb 5.10 or better you will have more options and if you aid climb you will have endless options.Climate?  One of the few places in the country that gets below freezing in the winter (we hit -10 last month but that was the first time since we moved here, 0 is more common though) and over 100 in the summer.

I'm discovering what you all discovered decades ago, as though for the first time. I wish I had a pack of friends to explore with, but it's ok. I feel safe and happy. Up until now I've been so focused on experiencing the obvious classic places and routes. Suddenly I'm pulled to places that have no name... or at least I don't know them.  Today was a spectacular day. I went back to the place I was yesterday, with my camera, and scrambled around front, back and sides of these beautiful rocks. They are not in any guidebook of mine so... I don't know how you find route info on them except to browse MP. I spent hours there, following lines with my eye. Maybe for the first time I'm wishing I had lead skills, because I can see the routes that may not be accessible to me on a top rope. This is eye-candy.  These couple of rocks will be a great place to explore, innovate, and get strong when I return. Slab, cracks, chimney, traverses... some thin finger lines, some off widths. I walked up directly to some of these routes and felt my way up the first few moves... the rock is just FINE. Not too gritty. I don't see much chalk. There are a few bolts on obvious lines.  With the exception of some crazy stuff it looks like there is a good variety of grades... 5.9's, 5.10 a-b maybe.So is this how it goes? You see a rock that calls to you, you check out lines that 'could' be a do-able route... you set up and try them out... play on them... experiment? Because these call to me. It's painful to leave town right now.I'm bummed because these rocks were in shade this morning and we could have been out climbing them. We leave for Sacramento tomorrow... and I will have to save this love affair for when we return. This is the rock formation on the right... if you're facing it from the parking lot.These pics are to the left side of the right rock formation: a little chimney/off width, some lovely finger jam cracks... what's not to love? And the rock to the left... the cool thing is, the farther back you stand, the longer the route appears. It just goes on, zigs and zags... maybe 60 feet?What an incredible summer!

Anyways, my questions:   -For those who have been, how easy was it for you to find partners in different places?  I know it shouldn't be hard to find partners for cragging but how about for alpine objectives (I plan on staying multiple months in Nepal/Pakistan, Huaraz, and Chamonix)?  Where is the best place to find such partners?  Are there any major climbing areas I should not plan on being able to find a parnter easily?  -When you aren't in the alpine (but still in a foreign country), where do you store all your gear?  Is it best to just rent a place for a couple months?  While this is primarily a climbing trip, I also plan on doing plenty of touristy stuff as well and don't want to be hauling around 100lb of expedition gear everywhere I go.  -In places like Nepal and Pakistan where expeditions are the norm, how easy is it to join on with another expedition in Kathmandu, for instance?

112896793,2017-05-18,cdec,"Lots covered here I want to add this.The levels of certification within the AMGA are about the terrain you can guide and instruct. The standards are the minimum and continuing professional development should be the goal for any professional. The prerequisites to take the course and exam and the 5 days it takes to get a SPI barely scratch the surface on the body of knowledge that one could and should accumulate if they want to be a good guide. SPI certification is not enough to guide for my company. It is one of the things we look for in guides, not the only thing.The problem, in general and specifically for Tico I think, is that this low level of training and certification is looked at as the end goal, not the beginning of the path, by some.I guide single pitch, short multi-pitch rock and ice and uncomplicated ski terrain. The AMGA offers training and certification for these types of terrain so I took the courses and the exams. I also read, practiced, participated in professional development clinics, skied, climbed and guided a shit ton.

114432808,2018-06-01,Nate Ball,"Old lady H:Madrone opening had nothing to do with peregrines. The closure was a condition set by an outside agency that scared the county into creating it before there were even any legitimate observations done. Now the entire park is closed for a majority of the year without any plan for determining to what degree peregrines and climbers can coexist.Many areas out here in the West are open for clear-cutting and are otherwise managed without any regard for healthy ecosystems or public recreation. This is incongruent with the stated intention of preserving a non-endangered species. Many of the experts working for the federal and state agencies are not being consulted and disagree with how the land managers institute their closures and/or the language they use to justify them.I am in complete agreement with you about being diplomatic and working through established channels. Unfortunately these are usually singular individuals who do not want their relationship jeopardized because they already get what they want, which isn't what the greater community wants. The general climbing population is unaware of the legal basis for these closures, the extent of the issue, and what (little) is being done about it. Raptors may be more sensitive than swallows, vultures, ravens, flycatchers, ducks, geese, and all the other hundreds of birds protected by the MBTA, but their sensitivity does not equate to legal protection. Most climbers will manage themselves because we love what makes these places wild and we want to protect that. This is far more motivating, and thus effective, because it happens from within the community rather than from a management agency which, looking at their own language, is only vaguely aware of how climbing and species preservation even works. It's almost like they just want to do as little work as possible. Yes, there will be idiots who try to climb in the Monuments area at Smith during the golden eagle closure, but other climbers will call them out, and this is far more effective than some signs telling them not to do it.Again, I am not advocating for ""messing anything up"". I am fully aware of how this may be viewed by certain individuals in positions of authority. But there are precedents for how to manage public areas in such a way that doesn't put hundreds (sometimes thousands) of climbers' access secondary to two non-endangered birds' mating success. Smith Rock. Yosemite. Squamish. Zion. Devil's Tower. The list goes on. But then there are areas with unnecessarily large closures without any protocols for integrating climbers and raptors. Madrone is one of them. Beacon Rock is another. There are dozens of smaller cliffs effected just in Oregon.If there is language out there written with the intention of informing climbers about how the land managers are trying to balance climbers' access and species preservation, I'm all for it. These will likely be in places where closures are minimal and based on actual observation by trained professionals, thus change year-to-year based on the birds' actual behavior. If I am missing something aside from ""leave the birds alone because they used to be endangered"" and ""some people are working really hard to establish relationships"" - like actual language or actual people - then please point me to it and I'd be happy to qualify my statements. Otherwise, I still think that climbing communities should be informing themselves of the legal language and the experts' observations and asking hard questions of those who manage the public land we would have access to if not for the nesting of some non-endangered birds.",2,Unknown Hometown,Aug 2010,8,,"Peregrine Falcons, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and Public Park Closures",5.121621621621622,24.55555555555556,663,0.1055213464696223,0.46566091954023

Or at least 'true' ones.I googled IQ/Intelligence as a subset of Openness, and... guess what? Nada to support that. So I asked.As requested, you corrected the semantics and provided a link, which I found and checked.Now we get down to things I can find and know about too, but didn't bring up, because they support my point, not yours. IE from your link:""Because Psychoticism appears to be differentially associated with Openness and Intellect, its association with the general Openness/Intellect factor is suppressed, and its linkage with normal personality dimensions may be best modeled at the aspect level. Our hypothesis for the present study was that the Psychoticism facets of the PID-5 would load on a factor with Openness specifically, whereas Intellect should mark a separate factor. ""And 'Intellect' is not, BTW, IQ. And clearly it is not 'the same' as Openness, though yes, correlated in some respects.I'd also not say things like ""the majority of people are not creative,""Because all people are also creative. The question is how creative they are. Behavior and Personality traits don't generally express as binary (0 or something else). With scores that have end points they are generally +/- from a mean or median, and with single-ended scales, nobody 'normal = someone you'd ever meet) really gets 0 or 100.So maybe that's a semantic thing again?But if I google ""most people are not creative"", or anything that supports the notion of a 0-creativity score as you imply in contrast to IQ, where everyone has one, I'm NOT going to find any scientific support for that notion. So with a raised Eyebrow I ask: ""What do you mean by that? Can you support that statement?""Anyway, it's cool conversation and it's getting to some interesting reading (IE: I had not realized that the DSM-V had picked up the CB5T, and indeed, I got to learn something today.), but that doesn't mean I agree with quite a bit of it.Now, for what it is worth, I really do agree that personal motivations are at the root of attraction to climbing, NOT IQ.

At the time a group of S African climbers decided that they preferred the Australian grading system to an older home-grown S African system, except they thought the Australian system could do with some tweaking (they thought it was too coarse in the 5.8/5.9 range and too fine in the 5.10/5.11 range). The climbers involved were big fish in a small pond and their views carried the day. Here's a 1984 article they wrote for a local mountaineering journal – in retrospect it comes across as quite arrogant. Originally the two systems were supposed to re-converge at grade 26 (5.12a) but somehow that fell by the wayside.One of these climbers now lives in the Boulder area. I could reach out to him if you're curious to know more.This is a super interesting piece of history, thanks for sharing! My main observation with the authors’ grade table is that it is a gross misrepresentation of the current Australian Ewbanks scale as compared to the YDS. Grade 24/25 is widely understood to equate to 5.12a/b, whereas grade 30 is equivalent to 5.13c.

Try riding a motorcycle in a metropolitan area if you want to live on the edge. You get to play Russian roullette against thousands or cell phone wielding, burger eating, distracted drivers. At least with climbing you have control of the majority of your situation.There are obviously things much more dangerous than climbing (pointing a loaded gun at your head and pulling the trigger, for instance). However, people do get seriously injured and die while climbing - rockfall (see recent death on Tahquitz), leader falls, cut ropes (see recent death on El Cap) etc. and so the question here is not a pissing contest about how we could live more on the edge, but rather how we rationalize exposing ourselves to these extra risks, if we rationalize it at all (the same question could be asked to people who ride a motorcycle in the city). Many climbers, for instance, started off hiking - that wonderful, safe joyride through the woods that John Long did ""on borrowed time"" (see recent Rock & Ice article) - and so climbing represents an activity we added to our lives that gives us increased exposure to death, and as we climb over the years the number of friends and family who have gotten seriously injured or died continually rises, so it's natural to ask ourselves ""why am I doing this?"" and ""is it worth it?""   The OP's question hits one of the key issues on the head: how have we grappled with this philosophical problem of death, and in climbing is the risk really worth the reward (now, it's asked to a crowd of climbers, so at some point every one of us will say, emphatically, yes, but at what point do we say no and why there)?",0,Unknown Hometown,Apr 2010,5,,Acceptance of death and climbing,4.648208469055374,40.0,360,0.1022424242424242,0.4123333333333333

Unlike both of you, I've actually used this knot in practice, many times, and I have to disagree. I've used it for dozens of rappels outside and probably hundreds of times in the gym (I like to maintain a good habit of tying a knot in the end of the lead rope). It has never slipped in the slightest, even when tied loosely and sloppily, or in brand new ropes, and I often don't even bother to tighten it well because it simply isn't necessary. I find it very easy and fast to tie, but I'll grant you that that my friends seem to have a harder time learning it. I've even seen incorrectly tied versions of this knot that I would trust more than a double overhand.   Btw I've also used this same knot for other non-climbing uses: As a stopper on the bungee cord for my Mammut realization shorts, when the plastic piece at the end came off; And in some thin cord I used to replace the spiral binding on a small notebook (to keep the cord from pulling through the pages). Neither has ever come loose, and I use the harness shorts every week, have washed them several times, etc..   Anyway, people can use whatever knot they want, but if you've ever questioned the reliability of a loose double overhand knot and wondered if there was something better, I highly encourage you to check out this knot. Read about it yourself, and try it for yourself, rather than reading misquotes and BS on Mountain Project, and see what you think.

The community is lots of climbers seeking that personal experience, that climb that means something to them. Whether its pulling on gear on a 5.9, free soloing a 5.11 after work, or yelling your way up a 5.14. Whatever personal experience tickles your fancy.   The problem is each person needs to define what an adventure is for themselves. An adventure to a brand new climber is a 6 pitch 5.6. An adventure to a professional climber is Cerro Torre, a trek to the north pole, a several hundred mile bike trip through a desert climbing 45 towers.   We are all seeking that adventure that really means something to us, that's why we got into climbing. With the advent of social media the climbing community is experiencing a population boom. Lots of new climbers who have an adventure plateau far less than someone who has been at it for a decade or two. This makes the average ""epicness"" of an adventure for the whole climbing community to be a bit less grandiose than the adventures of yore. Give them 10-20 years and they will have your same mindset.   I also don't believe dragging a camera around with your takes away from any adventure. Or a camera crew. The expeditions of Ueli Steck are no less adventurous with a camera crew there. How could they be?

Nobody needs a tree to be redundant, unless you’re looking for backup planets as well.As for “redundant” in this thread context, it’s a gray area what benefits, if any, this knot provides over a simple girth. Without pull/ drop tests we are just speculating over coffee here. Let’s just say that any girthy type knot is roughly reducing the strength down to say 55% of its unknotted strength. Question is At what additional force reduction will a simple girth or this knot in Dyneema start to slip (around a tree would also add significant friction factor to increase holding power) if one strand is cut (god knows how)..Probably the bottom line here is “no one cares”It never happens (enough to worry about) especially with trees.  There is no case that I would use this over a std girth hitch around any pole, tree, block, bollard, etc  For the same reason I don’t drive around town in a Nomex suit and helmet and my belay/rappel device only has 2 slots and not 4.  You can always make it safer, but do you really need to in this particular context?It’s an untested potential solution looking for an extremely rare problem IMOIt's possible that this knot could be stronger in Dyneema than the Climer/Climber's Hitch, and be easier to untie, and redundant (or 'fault tolerant' if you prefer) - which is at least not a disadvantage and at best an advantage. Actually, another term used by knot geeks is ""either end loadable"" - which accurately describes the conditions I'm trying to create, relative to each sling being hitched - that is I want either end of one sling to be pulled and not slip - but this might be confusing the issue further.""In general, knots reduce a line's breaking strength by about 50% (Jacobson 1999). Knots in which the line ""bends"" back on itself are weaker in general than are knots without bends. For example, the clove hitch (with no bends) has a breaking strength about 75% of the line's rated strength. In contrast, the square knot has a breaking strength only 45% of the rated line strength.""- geospectra.net/kite/knots/k…You can see the structure of the 4 bends inside the Handshake Hitch, represented here (as hitches, not bends, but as bends they are just hitched to opposite standing ends essentially):So you can see why I expect better strength with the handshake hitch than with the strop bend or the climer hitch - because those are essentially square knots and the Handshake Hitch is essentially two half hitches, which is according to above quote appreciably stronger structurally. The data may yeild a different conclusion, but I'm cautiously optimistic that we can improve on the only 55% strength of existing joins in Dyneema slings.If you don't care, you're welcome to leave the thread, but I appreciate you staying and bumping and offering your opinion.",0,"Exton, PA",Apr 2016,5,,"New, Maybe Redundant Sling Join - The Handshake Hitch",4.8273809523809526,40.2,603,0.0526736111111111,0.4568501984126983

I've reupped my certification three times in three separate areas with three separate examiners.    Were the examiners the same in their expectations? Definitely not.     Would one examiner require actions that directly contradict previous examiners statements from 2 year prior? You Betcha.    Thus, when people speak about their experience in the ""AMGA Way"" it's not unexpected that people would take their individual personal experience with a supposedly standardized test and extend to to be what every instance of  that standard will look like.    You're correct in that the official AMGA Way is to use the most efficient method that maximizes safety without adding undue time constraints. The problem is that some examiners and instructors follow the ""letter"" of that standard while others follow the ""intent"" of that standard.

Just treat it like a 9-5 (ie stay on top of your reading during the week between classes, etc) and most of your weekends are free. Plus I had a few semesters with no Friday classes, so I got out on weekdays sometimes too. 3rd year is fun—very easy.The problem is actually being a lawyer. If you go to a big firm, you’re not gonna climb much (although if you’re committed and have no family, you’ll find ways to get out here and there, and you’ll be able to afford last-minute flights when your case settles on the eve of trial). Other jobs (govt/public interest) will let you get out on weekends. But lawyers (and most of all, judges) don’t really believe in “vacation,” despite what anyone tells you during an interview. Definitely govt is better on this front. But the idea that someone might want to go away and not look at emails for a week or two is so completely foreign to most lawyers that you’re going to run into some friction in that front.Lots of lawyers on this forum will tell you they managed, and I’m sure they did. But they’re the exception. Generally lawyers are married to their jobs and not understanding of those of us who aren’t. And if you’re a litigator in govt or a small firm, you’ll find that your real boss is the judge you’re asking a continuance from, who probably got where he or she is in his or her career because they hate fun almost as much as they hate their families. Finally, it’s worth mentioning that location is a HUGE factor. If you’re in a big city, you’re going to be immersed in a workaholic culture. More rural areas are WAY more accommodating of work/life balance. (It’s not a coincidence that the schmuck is from New Mexico!!) I’ve done both and it’s a radical difference—even firmlife in Albuquerque is more laid back than govt work in NYC.So, it’s doable, but it’s not travel nursing, that’s for sure.Edit to give some bottom line advice: if you want to be a lawyer and also climb, work for the government in a rural area.

112835320,2017-04-30,jktinst,"Ha! Usually, ascenders, tiblocs, etc. get suggested much earlier in any discussion of self-rescue techniques involving prusiks. Up to now, each time I've seen these suggestions and wondered whether the particular circumstances or technique being discussed would indeed benefit significantly enough from these devices to make me want to carry them, my answer was always ""no"". Like Bill, I'm not keen to add stuff to the rack that I'm unlikely to need and I prefer the versatility, efficacy, bi-directionality and rope-friendliness of the prusik.However, I can see that if one is set to trust life and limb to an unbacked rope-grabbing system on a damaged rope (even temporarily) tiblocs could well be preferable to prusiks. If they are set too close to the damage, I don't think that there would be much difference between the two but set a couple of feet away from it, I can imagine that the tiblocs' teeth and the pressure from their biners (tensioned by a cord) may allow maintaining a secure grab on the rope in situations where prusiks might start to slip.The options I suggested for dealing with rope damage in a CB rappelling situation don't involve setting prusiks (or tiblocs) above or below the damage but, as has been discussed, like all other options, they have their own pros and cons. I normally climb trad multis on double ropes, keeping the rope paths separate. This makes it much less likely that both ropes might get damaged, as discussed earlier. As a result, the only situation I can think of where tiblocs could be really handy for me would be the very unlikely one where my second got incapacitated soon after leaving the previous belay on a rope-stretcher pitch, both ropes got badly damaged and there was no flat surface available to lower the victim to while keeping him belayed on both ropes. In this situation CB rappelling would not work, at least not until the damage has been securely dealt with. To do this it would be necessary to first descend the ropes to just above the damages and bridge at least one of them. This bridging should be more easily achieved with tiblocs than with prusiks but I'm really not convinced that I should add two tiblocs to my rack to make that kind of eventuality easier to deal with.Since I'm again talking about a very different scenario from the one posited by aikibujin, some additional thoughts on that might be useful. The first key decision is whether to lower the victim to the previous belay before escaping the upper one. Lowering may further hurt him and increase the risk of both ropes snapping but would save a lot of self-rescue shenanigans later to reach that belay station. Instead of anchoring the two ropes, after escaping from the belay, the rescuer should tie them together with an EDK and clip them to the anchor as for rappelling (but with extra-long tails if he decided to avoid lowering the victim). To clip them to the anchor, he should use the fattest biner available (ie one that would let the EDK slide from one side to the other, if necessary). If the damages are at about the same height, ideally, he would bridge the rope that appears to be least damaged but, of course, if they are not at the same height, he will need to bridge the first one encountered.He can then take stock of which self-rescue approach would make the most sense from that point on. Several approaches are possible but of course, if the EDK was tied with the extra-long tails, it's likely that none of them will allow reaching the previous belay station by simple CB rappelling. As mentioned, some shenanigans will be necessary to get there but that should still be much more feasible than if the ropes had been anchored without lowering first.",0,Unknown Hometown,Apr 2012,5,,Dealing with damaged rope in a counterbalance rappel,4.739938080495356,37.78947368421053,718,0.0626366120218579,0.4474668227946916

My argument is primarily against routes that just have bad or lazy bolting. You and I both want routes to be safer. You said yourself it doesn't make sense to have a route with a dangerous start when a high first bolt is such a simple solution. We agree that starts with significant groundfall potential are dumb and unnecessary. I just also think one should develop routes with how they will be climbed in mind. A lot of people here are saying that stick clips are extremely common in their areas. If that's the case then developing with them in mind makes sense. I rarely see them at the crags I frequent and I think at a crag like that it wouldn't be wise, but it seems that's rather unusual.You're pretty much advocating that ""more bolts"" is preferable to all the perfectly reasonable options listed above, which isn't a sentiment that's gonna get a lot of support around these parts. Not every 10a needs to be a candidate for everyone's first 10a.Firstly, I find it strange that you think I'm in favor of baby-fying routes. You're the one arguing for normalizing top roping the starts. I'm not arguing that the routes should have bolts every 8 feet the whole way up. Run it out if you want to if it's a clean fall, but a route with significant groundfall potential is lazy bolting and a hazard to the community.Secondly, why isn't that a reasonable option? Many modern sport climbing crags do exactly that. It seems to be a very popular idea. The Owen's River Gorge community has gone so far as to retrobolt your route if they think you've done a poor job of it and the guidebook has a warning to not bolt that way there or you can expect your route retrobolted and looked down upon. Loads of sport climbing places bolt how I'm talking about and it works out very well. I'm not calling for some revolution in bolting practices, I'm against lazy and dangerous bolting which unfortunately is predominately what I encounter when I go sport climbing. That's region-specific of course, though, and if I could climb 5.12 I wouldn't experience it even here since hard climbs are well-bolted here; developers choose to bolt climbs that aren't interesting to them poorly here and protect the climbs that they like well. So I wouldn't have anything to say if route developers around here put as much effort into 5.10s as they did 5.11s.I think that unless guidebooks make it clear that many routes exist in that area that were intended to be climbed with stick clips that you can't expect people to understand that. If you were to do a poll of people sport climbing at Castle Rock State Park or some small Bay Area crag then you would find sport climbers that own stick clips to be in the minority, and you certainly would not find that sport climbers think that stick clips are intended.Alexander Blum    wrote:Oh, a scary start is okay? What about a dangerous start? Is that okay?if 5.12b is your limit, the first twenty feet are a long V4, and the landing is rocky... what makes more sense. This scenario is extremely common at many sport climbing areas.a. Stick clipping a high first bolt. Simple, effective, requires a $50 tool (or a stick and some tape).b. Three bolts in the first twenty feet. If you blow clip two or three you’ll deck and likely break an ankle.If there are actually three bolts in 20 feet and there's groundfall potential you're either used to awful belaying or awful bolting.Also, in solution A, how many people actually use the stick clip? People keep on bringing up how many people own stick clips and how many you see at the crag. That isn't the metric to care about. If 30% of parties at a crag have stick clips you'll see a shit ton of them and yet they at that usage level they aren't anywhere near prevalent enough to assume that climbers will use them when developing a route. How many parties that climb any given route brought a stick clip or commonly use one?Because again, if you go with option A then you've now made the route more dangerous for all the people that don't own them, which is a factor everyone here seems happy to overlook. Why would you create anything without thought into how it will be used and taking that into consideration? If the vast majority of people own stick clips and there is an understanding between developers and climbers that stick clipping is not just OK but intended then this all makes sense. I don't think climbers think that around here at least. So this part is very region and community specific. If that's how things look in your area than option A sounds great. If it isn't then you've just made the route more dangerous for most people that will climb it.Further, I think the MP community self selects for people that think a lot about climbing and care about it a lot. There are an awful lot of sport climbers that just go sport climbing and don't think about it too much. Unless there's some education campaign or if guidebooks start talking about how stick clips are intended to be used I don't think it's reasonable to assume that climbers will know that. It certainly isn't a common idea around here (perhaps in Tahoe, it sounds like that area has a lot more stick clip usage).",2,"Angel's Camp, CA",Nov 2016,2,,An argument against stick clips,4.619877049180328,27.0,1107,0.0896903976111896,0.5980653779663679

My advice is use string or studs and clamps to make a mock-up on site and adjust plans accordingly.   Do not waste a single square inch of the wall on vertical terrain. That includes a kickboard. Just put in a few good footholds down low. The Sketchup model will result in a wall that under utilizes the space. A single 8x8 wall at 30 degrees overhung is all you need. Maximizing the length if you can't raise the height any will allow better traversing and diagonaling problems.   Looking at your photo, you are working with a cellar. I would drop 2x8s at a 30 degree angle, more or less, parallel to and off the floor joists right in to what is probably a concrete floor (?). A carpenter friend of mine said don't bother anchoring the studs at the base, just let them rest on the floor. The weight of the climber, the wood and the holds will keep everything in place.

Single pitch cragging can go either way, depends on how much separation anxiety the dog has and how much time you or your partner spend on the ground with it. Multipitch is problematic, your pup may spend a lot of time tied to a tree or boulder. Some dogs are completely fine with this others flip out, dig, make an ungodly amount of noise, destroy the vegetation etc. I think it comes down to the dog's personality, if its mellow, road-tripping/ dirt-bagging will be a lot easier.

122735307,2022-07-14,rgold,"Humans seem to have an irresistible urge to quantify, regardless of how much sense it makes to do so. The ""adventure"" aspects of climbing, which have to do with encountering and dealing with the unknown, are continually decreasing, for a host of reasons known pretty well by folks who have been around long enough to see the changes. The narrowing of the diversity of difficulty factors has made the grade far more important---because increasingly that's all there is.I personally think there is zero chance of coming up with a consistent, meaningful individual difficulty measure. And assuming that one could somehow identify and massage all the relevant variables into a measure that means anything, the brave new grades will instantly become subject to the same kinds of demands for more precision that have driven the grading system we have---whatever variables are perceived to have been left out will be demanded. Things will never be precise enough and the old complaints will just be replaced by new ones. Beyond that, just having a lot of objective measures doesn't guarantee ""objectivity,"" since the algorithms used to process those measures will be a human product. How much weight should we give to parameter x? Beyond this is another conundrum: the additional information makes the climb easier. Should the grade be lowered to reflect this loss of difficulty? Would there be some kind of downward spiraling feedback loop?It seems to me to be worth taking a deep breath and asking, ""Do we really need this information? Why exactly?"" Is the goal that no climb ever again presents anyone with an unanticipated moment of difficulty? Is the holy grail a data-mediated titration of just how much psychic and physical distress will be encountered? Do egos, wounded by a failure at a grade deemed too easy, need more robust protection? Do short and tall people and those with big and small hands need numerical quantifications of the advantages and disadvantages conferred by their stature?Grading systems have been around for quite a while. I think they all ultimately rely on the same simple idea. Take the full spectrum of climbs, apply some measure of overall difficulty, hopefully obtained from a consensus, and divide the list up into groupings of similar difficulty. Nobody could possibly imagine that this can or should confer the kind of precision now under discussion. And as I just mentioned, why should we be pining for more than the general opinion of a large group of folks who have tried the route?One reason is that the process hasn't worked very well. Even within the latitude provided, people disagreed on how grades should be assigned. I know a very prominent climber from those days who insisted that the grade for a climb should be the hardest move, so that the difficulty rating for a pitch with one 5.9 move and a pitch with, say, thirty 5.9 moves with no intervening respites should be the same---both should be 5.9. Talk about failing to alert the climber to the actual difficulty! When Chuck Wilts and Royal Robbins concocted the original decimal system for Tahquitz Rock (now fallaciously labeled the Yosemite decimal system), they gave example climbs for each difficulty level. The idea, of course, is that one had a standard to compare routes to and so obtain whatever level of consistency is achievable within a system subject to so many variables. I think subsequent guidebook authors dropped the ball and failed to provide their own table of standards for the climbs covered by their guidebook, something that would have gone a very long way to making the grades more consistent, both within and between areas. An attempt at this sort of thing was made in 1963, when Leigh Ortenburger proposed and tried to promulgate the National Climbing Classification System (NCCS). With some effort, he produced the kind of standards table I mentioned, but with different columns for different regions of the US. The system also got rid of the vistigial and almost immediately meaningless 5. in front of the grades, with, for example, 5.7 replaced by F7 (F for free) and some collapsing of the lower grades where no one can tell the difference anyway. He added the ""overall commitment"" grades I--VI and simplified aid grades to A1--A5. The overall and aid grades survived, but the pitch difficulty grades and comparison tables were basically rejected by guidebook authors. In some cases, one can't help but wonder whether there was some kind of misplaced pride involved in keeping sandbagged ratings. And so, without even a pretense of caring about consistency within and between areas, we end up with what we have. I think the only system that tries to account for human variations as opposed to presuming to offer some constant idealized difficulty to all is the British system, one that everyone outside the UK loves to laugh at. There is, in fact, quite a bit of method to their madness. You have an adjectival grade that gives information about the overall difficulty, including the level of seriousness and how sustained the moves are, and then a numerical grade that attempts to characterize the hardest moves. So within a given adjectival grade will be a range of crux-move grades. This corresponds to how humans actually approach difficulty. A person who might be fine leading well-protected 5.11 might drop down a grade or two if the protection is less good. The adjectival system tries to lump these difficulties into a single category which, in a sense, grades the climber in a way corresponding to most people's approach.The lack of precision and occasionally misleading nature of current grades could be viewed as a reflection of the fact that we are playing a game with mother nature without demanding she show us all her cards before we make any bets. As a member of a much older generation, I never signed up for that, but going forward the decisions and trends will be made by much larger demographic.

Besides, I just bought a new rackpack after my n00b partner dropped one of my draws onto hard-packed dirt from the anchors of a thirty-foot sport route. I sent it to Locker to inspect for microfractures in the dogbone, and he said that it was a goner, and that he would just dispose of it in an eco-friendly manner and save me return shipping. (Super nice guy).   Anyway, my partner that day ended up bootying TWO nice wiregates at the anchor. I guess the last person to climb it didn't have a PAS and had to bail at the chains. While we were arguing other whether he should rap or lower (I said always rap to respect the FA), he mentioned this thread where we could ask you a question about being a crazy badass woman climber. I told him yeah, I have a question, but wouldn't that be a great route name, ""Crazy Badass Woman Climber? (5.13d R/X)"" Cowen replied, ""No, that could be construed as patronizing and patriarchal and make you look like a caca-mouth,"" and that if I named a route that, he would tie a knot in my Dyneema sling when I wasn't looking.    So like I was saying, I had a question about ethics. I was going to ask whether pre-placed draws make a route easier, but everyone knows that question is sooooo Supertopo.

Perhaps some oddity in the way the 11 fell together or a blunder on the 8 for an individual. I would be hard pressed to call a climb out as 3 full grades different than the consensus. I would never trust my judgement that far so I wouldn't say anything. I've done thousands of routes and I've never found that big a disparity.Lech is quoting me, and yes, on that particular trip, I had flashed an 11a, and could not do a move on 5.8 after hanging and multiple tries. I looked up the names. The 11a is called Mr. Cute, at the 3rd buttress at the Meadow. I thought the 10a next to it (The Wanderer) was much harder than this 11a, but the large part of the difficulty was an awful bolting job on the 5.10a, not the climbing itself. I did both on the same day, as well as an 11c and 10d at the Second buttress. 10d was the only one I couldn't do that day, even after hanging and trying multiple times. I don't know the name of the 5.8 that I had trouble with, it was at a crag that was not in the guidebook. It is possible that the locals have sandbagged me on that 5.8, and it is actually a 10b or 11c. But who knows.And yes, I agree with you that I simply cannot trust my judgement when the grade disparity is that big. Which is why I have to do my mental grade adjustment.In case of 11a and 10a right next to it, both consensus grades in a published guidebook, I thought about it, and my decision was along these lines: This 11a suits my style, and it has multiple rests that are perfect for me, but maybe slightly harder for taller people to use. so that is probably why it feels easier to me. It is also overhanging, which is relatively rare at the New for the 11a, so that is probably the reason it gets a slightly harder grade locally. It felt easier than this 10, but at the same time, I think that it was this 10 that was harder than 10a, not that this 11a is really easier than 10a. But the 10a is not that hard. I had no trouble hanging out on it forever, and I was mostly having trouble with the clips, and the clipping doesn't count towards the grade, theoretically. So I upped the grade on the 10a in my vote, and lowered the grade on the 11a.

She had just never taken belaying seriously, or considered how a belay might fail. I had clipped a bolt above me and fell right after, to the ground. She had her hand on the brake side, but it was above the ATC and she got a burn trying to stop it from sliding through her hand.   After that incident, I don't climb anymore with strangers, and I vet my friends way more thoroughly. I supervise a lot of climbing Instructors, and now that I look more closely I see many, many mistakes that regular climbers make. Belaying is an understudied and underappreciated science. Until someone has proven that not only can they belay well, but they really care about belaying well, I have a trusted friend keep an eye on them close by, ready to grab the brake strand, or giving a backup belay. My trusted friends are few.   If I'm forced to climb with an un-tested belayer, I will adhere to Locker's idea of only easy leads, or I will get psyched to pull on gear to avoid a fall.   A gri gri solves the problem of taking rope in, as in a top rope situation, but it's a pretty bad thing to make a beginner lower with, or lead belay with, unless you have someone there teaching them. The process is more complicated than with an ATC. So, no easy solution there.   I'm done falling to the ground when I have a rope on me if I can help it.

It is a very good select guidebook, and covers the full spectrum of grades and styles of climbing.  It also give good coverage to the sport climbing at Chek.   The select book has a very brief section covering a small portion of the bouldering.  It is a nice intro and is enough for a few days, but if you do any more bouldering than that you will want to buy the bouldering guidebook.  There is only one bouldering guidebook option to choose from, and it is excellent.   There is also a lot of ongoing new route activity, and some real gems have been put up in the last few years, since either book was published.  It is really amazing what is getting dug out (literally) up there; some of the brand-new routes are just as good as the old ultra-classics.  The quantity of routes going up is remarkable as well; even the main walls on the Chief are nowhere close to being fully developed or explored, not to mention the many outlying crags.   Hopefully the new editions will cover these new additions.  Until then, though, you can find topos and info about new routes on the forums over at squamishclimbing.com.  They have a ""New Routes"" section to their forum, which is basically a depository of topos. The forum is pretty active, and new stuff is posted up regularly  If you spend any significant length of time in Squamish, it is worth browsing through--make sure to go back several pages to find all the good stuff-- and checking out the new routes.

Getting across the bridges into Seattle from the East Side at weekday rush hour is a huge hassle. Taking the train in to the city from the East Side isn't an option, since there isn't one. There are buses, but that is still a hassle. Public transportation in Seattle is very disappointing for a city of its size. You'd likely end up driving, and the traffic can be awful.   If you are working in the city, it is definitely going to be better to live in the city, as close to work as possible. That way you only have to do that drive a few times a week, as opposed to doing it every time you go to work. Also, the typical ""going to the mountains"" times (such as early Saturday morning) tend to have a lot less traffic than the ""going to work"" time (8:00 on a Tuesday).

Aim to peak each year, usually just before your cllimbing season ends. While recovery is important, I think your statement is not exactly true since recovery can be manipulated in many ways. (Also, hypertrophy is just one phase of the periodization cycle.) You address linear periodization, but this is only one type of training methodology tailored to athletes who have an ""off season"". Many athletes do not have an off season and therefore there are other types of periodization which do not employ long stretches of non-training (and to be honest, even athletes with an off season are not simply allowed to sit around and de-condition for long stretches--there is still a training protocol).To the OP: strength gains diminish less quickly than cardiovascular gains. It takes 4 weeks or more to return to baseline strength levels. Do not confuse atrophy as the sole indicator of strength loss. There are many neurological adaptations which remain intact longer than the visible size of the muscle.    The best way to prevent strength losses (that has been scientifically studied) is to train those muscle groups maximally at least once per week. This has been noted to maintain strength levels. So, if there is any way to get in one maximal climbing session a week, this should help.Nate K wrote:Does doing other forms of climbing in the winter, like mountaineering or ice climbing seem to preserve strenth you built up in the summer?They will maintain fitness but you were not completely clear about what specific types of strength you were concerned about losing. Mountaineering will probably help you maintain excellent aerobic and general fitness but not necessarily good grip strength or endurance. I haven't ice climbed but would imagine it would help maintain better grip and core strength but would not be helpful for the subtle varieties of grip strength (crimping, slopers, pinches, etc since it does not mimic these). Do they stack up better than doing nothing? Hell fucking yeah!    Nate K wrote:if youre already strong can you loose strength by climbing only easy stuff for long periods of time?Yes. Fitness gains and maintenance are proportional to the demands placed on the body. Reduced demand = reduced response. But it would keep you from completely de-training and maintain your skills.    Nate K wrote:How do you maintain strength when youre unable to climb?The only thing you could do is maintain a good general fitness with cardio and weight training. It's not a replacement for the specialized demands and adaptations resulting from climbing, but you will always come back quicker and stronger if you can maintain a decent to high general fitness level.
