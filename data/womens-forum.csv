Look up skeletons of other climbing primates such as monkeys, orangutans, etc. and you'll see that their legs are much shorter relative to their height compared to humans.People on this thread who say they'd take longer legs might be answering the question as simply ""would you like longer legs"" but the question is really ""would shifting your pelvis down a bit help your climbing?"" and I think for the average human the answer is yes.I'm 6'2"" and my legs are long for my height and anecdotally I often watch people with much shorter legs gracefully lift them up from a hanging position to place them on a foothold, in a way that would require a much much greater effort from me, and place much greater demands on core muscles. I think that's the key here -  you use your core to get/keep your legs up, and with less leg and more core, this is easier. Obviously it depends on the style of the climb and I think I benefit from my proportions on slab.

(One thing to think about is how you’ll probably need to use lower feet, and how having a tight core is super important to making those stretched-out moves—might be worth some extra attention to the extent you train.)(sorry to be a dude posting in the women’s forum, but I wanted to validate what you’re experiencing from my own (inverse) experience.)",1,Northeast,Apr 2013,Points: 31,4.6645962732919255

124575464,"Jul 11, 2023",Kate Blume,"Hi all! I’m having a laparoscopic excision surgery for endometriosis on Monday and wondering if anyone else has had a similar surgery and can shed light on recovery time. My doctor/surgeon says no physical activity at ALL beyond light household chores and brief neighborhood walks for 3.5 WEEKS until my post-op appointment which tbh as a very active person, feels like a death sentence. I was told “no heavy lifting” for 6-8 weeks (which I assume includes my entire body weight, so no climbing).Obviously I will listen to my doctors and I won’t do anything they say I shouldn’t, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had this surgery and can shed light on how long their actual recovery process was. I haven’t taken anywhere even close to 8 weeks off in the entire 7 years I have been climbing, so it feels very daunting to be told that. FWIW, my doctor expects my condition to be severe and the concern is not the incisions healing because they will be quite small, but the fact that she expects to spend 3-3.5 hours cutting endometriosis off my internal organs, which will then all need to heal. ",2,"Broomfield, CO",Aug 2017,Points: 5,4.630769230769231
124575464,"Jul 12, 2023",Bruno Schull,"Hey Kate, I feel for you.  For an active person that length of recovery time does feel like a death sentence.I'm a 50 years old, and I've had about eight surgeries in the last 20 years (I've lost track!), all for muskuloskeletal injuries, all with recovery times like yours or longer.  Like you, I am addicted to exercise, and have been since I was about 14.  Also, I have ADHD and OCD, which are partially releived by exercise.  And I have a family and a child.  Which is to say, if I can get through it, you can get through it!I have come to see the surgeries and the down time as a ""time out"" from life.  Nobody can demand anything from you, and you don't have to feel guilty about just resting.  I would just embrace that--it's not often in our crazy lives that we get a real chance to slow down and rest.Then, when you are ready, you could try new light exercises.  Running or walking with a foam floation belt in a swimming pool is really good.  Some physical therapy centers of gyms have ""hand bike ergometers"" (don't laugh, we do what we can!).   Static balance poses can be really hard (stand on one foot with your eyes closed...now do it with you torso inclined and one leg extended backward).  Light ski ergometers or ellipitcals or whatever other machines for cardio could work.  Maybe you're worried about finger strength?  Get some grip trainers or use a bucket of rice and develop the most iron grip ever.  Just don't overdo it.  I think you are absolutely right to focus on the internal wounds rather than the external incision.  You wouldn't want the internal wounds to start bleeding.  And that does make your situation difficult, because you don't want to excessively move your torso and abdomen, or put any stress or tension through your core.  It's going to be hard. But you have no choice, right?  I've heard endometriosis is really painfull, as well as underdiagnosed.  So this is a positive step.  Hopefully in the long term you will have less pain. So accept.   Adapt.  Go slow.  Be creative.  Try to see it as an opportunity or turning point.  You will come back stronger.  Good luck, and hang in there.  ",3,Unknown Hometown,Dec 2009,Points: 0,4.514435695538058
124575464,"Jul 12, 2023",Kat W,"Hi, Kate! I’m 7 weeks post laparoscopic surgery myself (full hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy), and I was told I had restrictions on everything except short walks and lifting up to 10 lbs for 6 weeks... I too had doubts I would really need *that* long to heal, especially since I already had an active lifestyle and had a textbook, complication-free recovery. Once I got past the initial ouchies and felt mostly like myself again, I admittedly did overdo it a little (walked a little too far, lifted a little too heavy when doing yard work), and each time, the next day, I definitely felt that I had sent my recovery a couple steps back. At my follow-up at 4 weeks, I asked my doctor if I *really* had to wait two more weeks to start running again, since I was feeling so good, and he explained that it really was important because after an internal trauma like that, the connective tissue basically needs to spin a new web around all the things (since it had all been detached during surgery) before you go engaging those muscles, which pulls on things internally, or jostling things around. I also have a girlfriend who lifted too heavy post-hysterectomy and sent her recovery WAY back because she herniated something up in there while she was healing. My advice is to roll with the short-term discomfort of having to hold back on activity so that you can experience the long-term gain of being able to do ALL the things (and with less pain!) after your doctor clears it. Use the time to explore simple pleasures that you normally don’t have time for during more active times in your life — reading, movies, binge-watching a good TV show (or a trashy one… I binged Gossip Girl during my recovery), crosswords, sudoku, coloring, drawing, writing, etc. Good luck, and speedy recovery!",4,"Minneapolis, MN",Dec 2019,Points: 0,4.710191082802548

The event's purpose is to bring together women climbers, including transgender, cis, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming climbers who feel comfortable in spaces that center around the experiences of women, for a weekend of climbing and camaraderie. We also partner with a locally-owned guiding service to offer both learning opportunities and guided climbing to our participants.  There is no fee for the event. The only costs are the campground fee of $10 per night and the cost of any clinics that participants choose to attend, such as self-rescue or guided climbing. Some scholarship funding is currently available to help with the cost of clinics or guided climbing if cost is a barrier. The event runs from Friday, September 29th through Sunday, October 1st, 2023, at Devil's Lake State Park in Baraboo, Wisconsin.

123958023,"Apr 2, 2023",Sarah Lydecker,"Exactly as the title says. I have a decent amount of outdoor mileage but feel weak as shit. For years, I’ve followed the “just climb” advice and found that’s been really beneficial in so many ways, but I’ve also hit a wall where progress feels completely impossible. And that wall is V4 boulders. I have started consciously bouldering 1-3 times a week since January and to be honest, it’s demoralizing.I feel like I am too old, too short, too fat to progress beyond V3. Personally, I also do not know any women who climb above V4 who were not active or climbers as youth. I do not have role models or examples of what realistic progress would look like for someone with my background. Speaking honestly, it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me that I still struggle to do more than one pull up. My boyfriend and brother have both been climbing for less time than me but climb harder boulders and have progressed faster through the V grades.I know that Lynne Hill is petite, I know how tall Sasha DiGuilian is, I know and madly respect how bold Brette Harrington is and I am VERY aware that the pro female climbers don’t suffer for their height. But also I know that these pros have been climbing all their lives and have access to resources I do not have. I’m just a mid-30s climber who wants to believe she hasn’t peaked but I don’t know any women who started climbing as an adult and have no frame of reference for what is normal progression for my demographic. I would really, REALLY, appreciate some personal anecdotes on what progression looks like. I want to set realistic expectations for myself and that happens when I compare myself to other older women, not to pro climbers or dudes with the testosterone advantage.Please note: if you are not AFAB or a certified climbing coach with experience working with older XXchromosome clients, I do not want your opinion on this post. I would like this conversation to remain on topic and not be shut down by the admins.

123958023,"Apr 3, 2023",Lena chita,"I had my first exposure to climbing in mid-20s, then had two kids, and only started climbing regularly in my early 30s. I couldn’t do a single pull-up when I started. I can certainly climb harder than V3, do more than one pull-up, and know plenty of women who are in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s who also do.Since this makes me qualified to comment, first and most important thing: what if I were a hypothetical messenger from the future, telling you that you would still be only climbing v3 20 years from now? What then? Would you quit climbing, if I tell you that you have hit your ceiling? Then quit! Right now! Spare yourself the frustration!Step back, and remember why you climb. You will never be the best at it. You will never be in the top 20%, even.  Why do you do it? Remind yourself WHY, when you are frustrated. And stop comparing yourself to others. What does it matter if your progress is the same or slower than average female who started in mid-20s? Quitting time, if slower? Then quit.Now that the most important thing is out of the way… bouldering is definitely the way to get stronger. But 3 months of bouldering “1-3 times a week” is not much time at all. And I’m not the fly on the wall to know what exactly you do when you go bouldering, so it is even harder to say what you could realistically expect from it.I would strongly suggest hiring a couch, or signing up for a remote training plan, such as Lattice or Power Company.

123958023,"Apr 3, 2023",Frank Stein,"My wife is 4’11” and started climbing when she was 30. For two decades she was stuck at 5.11 something (she’s not really a fan of bouldering), but when the pandemic hit, she decided to start training instead of just going to the gym and having fun. This meant hangboard, systems wall and campus board…and, viola…within a year she sent her first .12a and .12b. She’s done a bunch of them now.However, I have to admit that she was a gymnast in college, and when I met her, she was as strong as an ox. She also has some chronic issues from her gymnast days. Over the decades, she lost some of that power, and it got to the point where she could do only about five good pull-ups. Once she started training, I told her that I’d throw her a party when she hit ten. It did not take long for her to have a party. ",10,"Albuquerque, NM",Feb 2012,Points: 190,4.127388535031847
123958023,"Apr 3, 2023",claty,"I started climbing in my 30s. Didn't play a single sport growing up -- typical immigrant upbringing where i was on the math team, physics team, was on the PA academic bowl state championship team, went to an ivy league college and got a degree in physics. My academic calendar right leave any time for sports and even if it did, my parents didn't let me participate in any. The only class i didn't get an easy A in was gym class because I was (am) so uncoordinated. I do very much believe that i missed out on some crucial neuromuscular development by not playing sports growing up and climbing hasn't come easy. I've had a series of injuries that my friends who started climbing or playing sports young never had. I also had a really bad climbing accident in my first season and now only have one working leg. And after 10 years of climbing I have redpointed mid 5.13 and sent v7/8... before i even ever started training. I don't believe I'm some naturally talented athlete. I just spent the past 6 weeks in the gym focused on bouldering instead of outdoor climbing and although i didn't follow any kind of structured training program, I'm excited to see what happens when i go back outside. I started lifting and hangboarding a bit and after a week break to travel i flashed multiple v4s and sent a couple of v6s on the moon board which was always my nemesis. It's frustrating to see a lot of climbers who started in diapers casually walk up my projects, and i have to remind myself not to dwell on the fact that i started late. I laugh when i see articles about ""older"" climbers managing to send hard in their 30s because i didn't even start until after that. My partner started climbing before he could walk and after an entire season off due to work, he's annoyed that he fell on his 5.13 warmup. I'm psyched to redpoint that grade! anyway i don't have any specific advice for you or an idea of what ""normal"" progression should look like but this is what my climbing career looks like so far. I onsighted 5.11 sport my first season, and then spent the next few years focusing on learning trad. I also slowly progressed through the grades but agree that i was stuck at v3 for a very long time. I was onsighting 5.12 sport before sending v4 outside, but i also almost never bouldered. I had multiple injuries in years 4-6 that derailed my climbing for entire seasons. Then I spent a year mountaineering instead of technical rock climbing. Quit my job and spent a 9 months climbing and went from 5.12 to 5.13 around year 9. Year 10 i had a personal heartbreak and walked away from climbing to surf. This year I'm back to climbing and was consistently one hanging a 13a before conditions turned bad, after just 2 sessions to work out the moves. I just wrapped up my ski season and will see how things go for the rest of this year! ",16,"Cornudella de Montsant, Esp…",Jul 2012,Points: 10,4.404580152671755
123958023,"Apr 10, 2023",Lenore Sparks,"Hi Sarah! I think there are so many excellent comments on this forum already, especially about not comparing yourself to others and also that three months of bouldering is nothing compared to the hours (years) needed to progress at climbing. I too was not an athlete, EVER, and I sometimes feel really jealous of people I know whose parents took them to gymnastics or even took them climbing as kids. I can't change my past. Instead, I look inward and decide what I can do each day to make myself a better person and also perhaps a better climber. Sometimes that goes together! There are a few ingredients I have learned from friends of mine who are pro coaches (I stole their beta while they were coaching other people haha):1. Give 100% EVERY TIME you climb. If it's a warm up, execute each move with perfect form and breath. If it is a project, go to it with a focused mind and give it everything! (Justin Sjong advice)2. Choose the higher foothold. You have a choice of footholds? Take the highest one you can. This helps if you are short, and helps you improve technique. (Jim Redo advice)3. Watch better climbers and learn. What do they wear? What gear do they use, or more importantly NOT use? What warmups are they doing? I learned how to climb as an adult in Boulder and watched Alex Puccio and Angela Payne climb and I do what they do. Am I as strong? No, but I'm better than I was before. 4. Lean into your partners. Tell them what you need, why, and when. I learned this from my friend Lor. Give your spotters or belayers jobs and lean into the drama that comes from the investment in your goals and the work it takes to achieve those goals. Say ""I need you to remind me to breathe and to get my foot up at this move."" Or ""At bolt six please encourage me to go á Muerte!"" And shout out or put on a show when things are hard so that you engage in a way that shows your partners this is meaningful. (Justin Sjong advice) You don't have to climb hard number grades to try really hard and be invested. You just need to try hard ALL THE TIME and not take or give up. Let your partners help with this.5. If you feel ready, start a hangboard or campus board routine. This will strengthen your fingers, but more importantly ritualistically set your focus to being intentional with your time devotion to climbing. I SUCKED at pockets when I first moved to Germany, then I hangboarded for 10 minutes 3x/week (Metolius 10 minute workout) and started onsighting many climbs in Frankenjura within a year. But it took a devoted YEAR. 6. If you aren't seeing big gains, focus on micro-gains and how to get them. Micro-gains is a term I made up for overcoming injury after injury. They come from stretching, lifting weights, running to improve cardio, eating beautiful organic food instead of cheetohs, practicing memorizing beta, memorizing beta, wearing better shoes, wearing nice clothes I feel confident in, finding better belayers, waiting for send temps or humidity to calm down, ect...7. Work at least 40% on your weaknesses. It's fun to climb what we are good at! Weeeee! But if you want to improve, climb on things that are difficult for you. If you catch yourself saying ""I hate slopers""... Well, you should get better at slopers somewhere like Fontainbleau. If you hate slab, go to Tuolomne for the summer. If you seek to improve, you had better work the weak points. (advice from J Star)8. Be the first to the crag and the last to the crag. Don't leave early because you want to cook dinner or get home before rush hour. You are here to climb, so max that time out! I never improved when I was the person to finish a session early because of other commitments. Commit to climbing. Period. (when you are to be climbing) Your best accessory in your backpack is a headlamp.9. Stop drinking alcohol. You have less energy, sleep like crud, it makes you retain water and overloads your body with estrogen mimicking molecules. I climbed worlds better when I stopped drinking. I read somewhere that Wendy in Rifle quit drinking wine to send her 13d project at age 50? Drinking is difficult to quit, but can really be a game changer.10. Last but not least, have FUN. That's the whole point. When I am sad, or discouraged, or need a boost in climbing, I surround myself with amazing friends and just go out and have a blast. Jokes, encouraging others, and giant hugs can make all the difference in a day and remind you why you climb in the first place. You may never progress strength-wise past V4, but you should make life long friends in the process of trying and that is the best part of all of this anyway.

Chemo brain fog is a real thing.  It is insidious and it sneaks up on you.  It will lift and then come again.  I am about six months out and I finally am feeling like the fog is lifting.  Fatigue and ability to recover my energy also waxes and wanes and is sometimes seems arbitrary.  Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to rest when you can.  We are used to being strong women who can go, go, go and push through pain.  It is OK to give yourself a break and/or ask for help...and this will continue to be part of your life....and it takes time to make this mental shift. 4.  Be mindful of your blood counts and be kind to your body in respect to where they are.  That being said I did climb when I was anemic and actually climbed pretty well.  I did however need to listen to my body.  If I felt light headed I would stop, I made sure to wash my hands a lot and or use and alcohol based liquid chalk.  I tied to not climb when there gym was busy especially when my ANC was on the lower side.  I would wear a mask in they gym but admit I took it off when actually doing climbs.  I was also mindful of my platelet count in terms of scuffing my hands.  5.  Both my oncologist and my surgeon were very supportive of me climbing during my treatment.  They trusted me to limit myself and read my body...having this type of relationship with my medical team was imperative for me.  I had one consultation with a radiation oncologist who was both dismissive and put off by my extensive questions about potential radiation fibrosis and how it may affect my shoulder/affected upper extremity range of motion.  I did not go to this person for my radiation.  I found a different radiation oncologist with whom I had a very open dialogue about my concerns.   6.  You are the expert of your body and how you want to use your body as you plan for your survivorship!!!!!!7.  I did choose to have reconstruction.  Because of radiation this will are a two stage process for me.  I had to push a little bit, but my surgeon was amenable to me having my implants placed above the muscle.  This option prevents manipulation of the position of the pectorals major and the stretching of the pec major over the implant.  This requires that the surgeon be comfortable crating a pre-pectoral pocket for the tissue expander and ultimately the implant.  8.  None of this is an exact science.  I am still haggling with my surgeon about the size of my current tissue expanders as I feel they are way bigger than I had asked for them to be.  There is a certain understanding that they need to fill the space created and account for the potential of tissue necrosis and or conjecture of the skin after radiation.  On the other hand there does seem to be an aesthetic bias to visually larger, fuller breast by the cosmetic and reconstructive surgery community.  I have spoken to a handful of female athletes (climbers and runners) who all say they asked to stay small and ended up about a cup size larger than their original breasts were.  I think this is an are that needs to be further explored and discussed as more women are requesting to stay small without going flat if that is what they desire in their survivorship.  There is a perception and it is only about a look.  I can say I have been very disheartened because my climbing and outdoor layering clothing is currently a reminder of my cancer.  I hope in time female athletes can begin to shift the needle in this discussion and we can lead the reconstructive surgery community to understand choosing reconstruction has more to do about how we feel in our new bodies rather than just how we look.9.  I still have about 8 (of 9) more IV immunotherapy treatments until I will go into cancer surveillance mode.  I started these treatments two days after I finished radiation.  I was actually surprised  how tired I was at the end of radiation.  I also didn't have the immunotherapy by itself in the past so I couldn't discern what all make me tired.  I will have a better idea of how the Keytruda affects me as I get deeper into this round of treatment.10.  Jumping back to post surgical concerns.  Although it is not yet standard of care, seek out a PT that specializes in Lymphatic drainage and cording prevention/treatment and have a consult before surgery.  When you are fully healed from surgery begin regular sessions to treat any scars along the lymphatic vessel that have developed.  Begin range of motion as early as possible.  When you are cleared to do so begin stretching on the wall on jugs moving thought all planes off motion.  Keep your smaller supporting rotator cuff muscles strong before and then after surgery.  Everything will want to scar and pull your shoulders forward.  A good massage therapist who specializes in lymphatic massage is also very helpful.  Right now some days this feels like a two steps forward, one step back journey.  That said, my surgeons and oncologist all have said that my range of motion and minimal cording are excellent (even if I still feel some deficits).11.  This is your journey.  Prepare like you would for your hardest redpoint: plan, train, practice, and be ready to pivot and rework certain moves if necessary.  Start your journey with the intention that YOU WILL SEND THIS!!!!  12.  Email a friend who has been thought this (caccaloeb@gmail.com is my email)That's more than enough for now!!!           ",16,Unknown Hometown,Sep 2022,Points: 0,4.594457013574661

I am looking for a new harness that fits me better and am stumped because I wasn't planning on buying a new one so soon.

The leg loops have a small elastic section, so they move and expand as I flex and bend, and I have to say it sounds like whatever but it’s the most comfortable adjustment I’ve ever felt in a harness (I used to wear a series of petzls, arcwteryx, bd, none of which had this). It’s also so much cheaper. I don’t know why Petzl has decided their harnesses are twice as valuable as everyone else’s. This cost 80€.  The only drawback is that the extra flexibility wears out the stitches of little stint that holds the two leg loops together under the anchor point.

Stop immediately. Hi Mnt File--I admire you post.  It's powerful and strong and honest.  At the same time, I have some real reservartions.  It will take me some time to get there, but, bear with me, I'll come back to the main point.  First of all, I don't need to tell you that for centuries women have been subjugating their lives and roles to men.  That's obvious.  I saw a headline recently; it was a play on the common theme that behind every good man there's a good woman.  It said something like, ""Imagine what these women could have achieved if they had had a wife.""  The point being that if more women were supported by self-sacrificing partners--as men so often are--they could have achived even greater things.  What's strange for me personally is that in my family the dynamic was reversed; both my parents worked, but my mother was the career driven breadwinner, and my father took a backseat supportive role.  The same dynamic played out in my 20 year marriage, (which finally ended this summer).  My ex-wife was the career driven breadwinner, and I played the supportive backset role, most importantly, as the primary care giver, and main source of support and guidance for our now 13 year old daughter.  (Incidentaly, my sister also became a badass, a tenured professor in a competitive field at a highly prestigious university).  In my family, the woman are the ass-kickers :)I always worked (as a high school teacher, earning about 1/3 of the family expenses) and I always climbed, but both my own career and my climbing were compromised by my commitment to my family.  Weekends in the winter when I took off to go ice climbing, or period in the summer when I could go to the mountains for a week ior ten days always felt like a great, long-dreamed-for holidays, and I didn't feel guillty that I was neglecting my family, because I put so much time in cooking, cleaning, shopping, and caring for my daughter, that it felt well-deserved.But there's always something lost.  If I had not spent that time with my family, I would have been able to climb more, improve my skills, have more amazing experiences, realize my passion, and so on.  I'm not discounting or mocking these things--they are truly valuable.  In many ways they are the core of my identity.  I often watch alpine climbing and mountaineering videos.  These videos are inspiring but also dissheartening, because I know that, in comparison, my achievements, while powerful for me, are decidedly mediocre, and always will be. So finally I come back to your post. What does someboidy get in return for sacrificing and compromising?   Well, what I have gotten is the most powerful emotional connection I have ever felt with another human--my bond, friendship, love, and connection with my daughter.  That's not bullshit, that's the truth.  It's the deepest relationship I've ever had.  For me, that seems like a pretty good trade off for a mediocre climbing life!  That is, I would rather have a deep connection to another human than be an amazing climber.  So I think that's the fundamental counterpoint to what your write.  To pursue a life of ""I come first"" is empowering, especially for women, who so often sacrifice themselves for or are simply pushed aside by men.  But this approach could lead to an essentially selfish life of lonliness and missing relationships with children, for example.  Again, I'm not trying to criticize you, although I acknowledge that my words could be interpreted as challenging or hurtfull.  I admire your strength.  I'm just trying to offer a counterpoint.",26,Unknown Hometown,Dec 2009,Points: 0,4.726158038147139

They are also the extreme outliers. Hilaree Nelson was my single most inspirational hero in the mountains and she had a full family and successfully balanced both lives seemingly well. For every example of a honnold support situation, there are 10,000 other climbers who aren’t committing fully to their passion because it would be a direct trade off with other important personal parts or their lives.You’re free to fully commit this very moment and pursue all of your wildest dreams and passions but it will always be a sliding scale of sacrifice and reward. Asking why you can’t have everything you’ve ever wanted in life all at once (happy family, successful career, every passion fulfilled) seems a bit detached in not understanding a very basic “give and take” rule.

They can be much thicker than a down jacket before they start messing with your freedom of movement. They will be able to keep your core warm, which is key in keeping your extremities warm. Just some thoughts: 1) many people have a tendency to 'over-layer', ie. to up the number of midlayers, instead of changing the midlayer. This is counterproductive because at some point the midlayers will get squashed together meaning less air can be trapped, and also sweat evaporation will be limited. Generally speaking, one baselayer, one midlayer, a shell plus one reinforcement layer for standing still should be all you need. This also makes sure your freedom of movement is not too limited. 2) it's very hard to actually put a number on comfort temperature of each individual garment and even harder to do that for combinations. This is because it is extremely dependent on personality and circumstances. How much have you eaten? How did you sleep? How long is your trip? What are you doing? Are you belaying or climbing? What is the wind doing? Precip?3) Trapped air is warmth and therefore thickness is warmth. Even the best thin down jacket has its limits when it's not even a centimeter thick.4) The temperatures you describe (just above freezing, or just below) are extremely tricky because  it can mean that the air is moist, limiting the insulating capabilities of down. For those temperatures, it's worth it to look at synthetics or wool. 5) Always bring a reinforcement layer. ",10,Netherlands,Feb 2020,Points: 0,4.8509933774834435

Some things are easy to do while bouldering, but not practical on multipitch.

(Some people go even further and have quilted down pants). You take the top layer off for climbing, and put it right back on as soon as you find back down.Top: tank top, short-sleeve shirt, long-sleeve shirt (such as OR Echo tee), full-zip fleece, and a heavy down jacket (Rab Neutrino, in my case).I do not ever hike in a down jacket, even when it’s cold. Yes, I feel quite chilly when I start the hike, but by the end of it I’m warm, and then I put on the down jacket as soon as I stop.i sometimes climb in my fleece, but mostly I take it off and climb in the long-sleeved tee. Again, it is cold when I start, but usually by the end of the pitch I’m warm.I had two pairs of gloves. Really heavy insulated skiing gloves, and double-layer fleece gloves with leather palms. I can belay wearing either. I don’t wear both at once, it’s just so I have a choice. I DIDN’t have a hat. This is silly. While the hood of my down jacket is quite warm, a hat makes 10000% sense! But I forgot it, lol  I also had extra help in the form of hand warmers. I have rechargeable hand warmers that I put into my climbing shoes at the start of the hike. Putting on warm shoes for climbing makes a huge difference to me! And while I’m climbing, the hand warmers are sitting in my approach shoes, warming up the socks that are tucked in. Putting on warm socks after climbing makes another little moment of happiness.You might need more of those kinds of external helpers. There are electrical heated socks. I haven’t tried, bc I don’t need to, but you might. You can also put those single-use chemical toe warmers into your approach shoes, they are thin enough to keep inside the shoes while wearing them. You can put hand warmers into your chalk bag, and/or into the back of your gloves (skiing gloves have a special pocket for it, but just sliding them into the backs of your regular gloves works, too.A friend of mine has a portable propane heater. This can make a huge difference for someone who spends a lot of time not-climbing, like, if your partner is taking an hour on a climb… Also little things like: what are you sitting on? Sitting on the cold rock/ground can leach the heat out of you fast! Have a scrap of an old thermarest, or something else insulated.And bring hot beverages in thermoses! Even if you don’t like coffee/tea, or in addition to a thermos of tea, I put hot water into my hydro flask, it keeps the liquids warm surprisingly long, and makes my day so much better.Another friend of mine brings a jetboil to the crag.. ",1,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.4573378839590445

Some things are easy to do while bouldering, but not practical on multipitch. And there’s a reason why more people switch to bouldering when it’s really cold!Here what I do (climbed single-pitch sport last weekend with the worst day being high 30s and cloudy, planning on more of the same this weekend, though, fingers crossed, it would be sunny)Bottom: heavier leggings, thick wool socks, leg warmers to protect the ankles/slide over the tops of climbing shoes; and fleece pants that pull over on top of the harness. (Some people go even further and have quilted down pants). You take the top layer off for climbing, and put it right back on as soon as you find back down.Top: tank top, short-sleeve shirt, long-sleeve shirt (such as OR Echo tee), full-zip fleece, and a heavy down jacket (Rab Neutrino, in my case).I do not ever hike in a down jacket, even when it’s cold. Yes, I feel quite chilly when I start the hike, but by the end of it I’m warm, and then I put on the down jacket as soon as I stop.i sometimes climb in my fleece, but mostly I take it off and climb in the long-sleeved tee. Again, it is cold when I start, but usually by the end of the pitch I’m warm.I had two pairs of gloves. Really heavy insulated skiing gloves, and double-layer fleece gloves with leather palms. I can belay wearing either. I don’t wear both at once, it’s just so I have a choice. I DIDN’t have a hat. This is silly. While the hood of my down jacket is quite warm, a hat makes 10000% sense! But I forgot it, lol  I also had extra help in the form of hand warmers. I have rechargeable hand warmers that I put into my climbing shoes at the start of the hike. Putting on warm shoes for climbing makes a huge difference to me! And while I’m climbing, the hand warmers are sitting in my approach shoes, warming up the socks that are tucked in. Putting on warm socks after climbing makes another little moment of happiness.You might need more of those kinds of external helpers. There are electrical heated socks. I haven’t tried, bc I don’t need to, but you might. You can also put those single-use chemical toe warmers into your approach shoes, they are thin enough to keep inside the shoes while wearing them. You can put hand warmers into your chalk bag, and/or into the back of your gloves (skiing gloves have a special pocket for it, but just sliding them into the backs of your regular gloves works, too.A friend of mine has a portable propane heater. This can make a huge difference for someone who spends a lot of time not-climbing, like, if your partner is taking an hour on a climb… Also little things like: what are you sitting on? Sitting on the cold rock/ground can leach the heat out of you fast! Have a scrap of an old thermarest, or something else insulated.And bring hot beverages in thermoses! Even if you don’t like coffee/tea, or in addition to a thermos of tea, I put hot water into my hydro flask, it keeps the liquids warm surprisingly long, and makes my day so much better.Another friend of mine brings a jetboil to the crag.. I actually do have Raynaud's! The primary form. Mine's worsened by humidity, so damp and a little cold is worse than even colder but dry. That makes sense about bouldering! I'm thinking single-pitch sport. Thanks for the heavy down jacket recommendation! I definitely need a puffy, either a light one for while climbing or a heavy one for in between climbs. I should probably pick up another rechargeable hand warmer. When it's really cold, they seem to run out of a charge faster.

In fact, I probably did sleep in it, once or twice, lol! Anything with batteries of any sort dies faster in the cold, so bring two hand warmers. Rechargable is great, make sure a cord for that lives in your car.Most of what I listed in this thread is from my ice/alpine friends, or my bouldering buddy. The other thing my badass boulder friend did, was to put his climbing shoes on the car dash, to get toasty on the drive. Then he'd stuff them in his jacket for the short walk to our boulder field.

What ended up working for me is layering two down puffys over a warm base layer. It sounds weird but one's a jacket and one's a vest, so it doesn't constrict movement to wear both. They're also lightweight despite the jacket being 800 fill power and the vest being 600fp.

I know some brands are probably better but I love that these were cheap because I don't have to worry about roughing them up. Then I wear my snowboarding hat and put a heat pack in each pocket and glove which I switch to my shoes when I alternate belaying and climbing. I just always have a heat pack in each pocket when I go up the wall incase my fingers start to get numb on the rock. Having an extra layer pants helped a lot too.

Pros: they're a nice, thicker-weight material, and offer a generous 50% discount for industry workers. Cons: The rise is really low - the button and internal drawstring press into my pelvis and become uncomfortable after a few hours of wear with a harness. The pockets are very shallow, can't fit my phone (in either the front or back pockets), and always bulge and look bad. The closure components are too much (two buttons, drawstring and zipper?!), and I often forget to zip the zipper - too many steps after a bathroom break! With my frame, I'd get a lot of gapping at the back, which required me to cinch the drawstring tight, making the fabric bunch up quite a bit. Also, the placement of the snaps for rolling up the legs was unusually high and looks awful, imo. I only have their original version of the pant, so not sure if any of these pain points were modified for their current version. I recently got a pair of E9 Onda Story pants and I love them. The material is lightweight and breathable, but feels durable (haven't put them to the test on too much natural rock yet). I love the elastic drawstring at the hem of the legs, and the waistband is really comfortable and rides higher than prAna pants. There's a button, but the waistband has elastic so I don't need to unbutton them to use the bathroom. Other things I love: elastic loops on each side for a chalk brush, DEEP pockets, organic cotton. They would definitely suit someone taller than me, but I don't feel like they look weird on someone with my frame. They also come in a nice range of colors. I do have the prAna Olivia shorts, and I've been really happy with them.

118559890,"Feb 19, 2020",Taylor Neff,"Hello everyone,I was wondering if any of the ladies here could help me with this question. The context is that I am a transgender woman and a semi-active climber. My transition has always included getting top surgery/breast implants/reconstruction.I went to the consult a short while back and when I told the surgeon that I climb about once a week for the whole day outside he had a lot to say. He said that if I rock climb once a week, that it is too frequent with breast implants that go under the muscle. He said it's highly likely that I will cause them to shift and move out leading to a ""double bubble"" effect similar to what female weight lifters can get. Furthermore, that I will feel the muscle laying on top of the implants move over them when I flex which will be distracting. The best thing I could do, would be to stop chest exercising and limit my climbing to... once a month. This includes the gym, push ups, and pull ups. If I don't, he will have to fix them eventually.He said going over the muscle was a bad option for me. Since I am trans the tissue is too limited for him to work with and do a good job. It's highly unlikely, given that I am trans, that I will grow much more which is why I've been recommended this surgery.The thing is, the doctor isn't totally sure when it comes to climbing. He simply doesn't have many climbers under his care. I've asked other doctors and it's the same thing. They just don't really know because they don't climb and it's such a different activity.This has been pretty upsetting and distressing. Climbing is a huge part of my life, but so is my identity. The climbing community is the main community I am part of. I feel like I am being asked to choose between who I am and the community I love to be part of. A community that accepted me without any reservations.Have you had breast implants under the muscle? How did it affect your climbing? Are you still as active in climbing as you were before? Did it hurt your ability to lead safely? Do you know someone who has? What has their experience been like?I know this can be a very sensitive topic to post about publicly. If you want to share but not post here, please feel free to send me a private message.

118559890,"Feb 19, 2020",Em Cos,"Unfortunately I don't have any experience with implants to share with you, and I hope you can find that from others. I do have experience with doctors and the climbing-related advice they give - and in my experience, knowing absolutely nothing about climbing beyond their own vaguely-formed assumptions does not usually stop them from speaking with absolute confidence about what you can and can't do. I also have experience with doctors who are very familiar with climbing, and will accept your athlete mentality - as in, they will support your choice to prioritize climbing as an important and non-expendable part of your life, and give you a treatment plan that will help you get back to it, rather than say you just shouldn't do that activity anymore because that's the safest path.I'm not sure which type of doctor you're working with, but until you know I would take their climbing-related advice with a huge grain of salt. Ask what their experience is with climbing, if they have treated other climbers, and what data they are using to determine their recommendations. It seems very odd to me to say that climbing once a month is fine but once a week is a bad idea - maybe it's true but that would raise some questions in my mind, especially if that wasn't accompanied by a lot  of questions about the style, duration, and intensity of the climbing you do. (For example, if the issue is chest muscles developing too much, I have a hard time imagining a 10-pitch slab-fest would be a problem even if you did it daily.)I would try to find a doctor that has experience or knowledge of climbing, or at least supports an athlete mentality, and even if this one does, try to get a second opinion. I recognize both of those things may be easier said than done.I hope it doesn't come down to you having to make a difficult choice between the activity you love and the body that will feel right to you. If it does, I hope you find the support you need from others and are able to find peace with your choice. While not every climber can relate to your exact circumstances, there are hardly any of us that haven't had to make choices about trade-offs between climbing and injury risk, health, career, life-style, relationships, kids, ...etc.... it's hard to find the right balance and I hope that you do.",21,"Boulder, CO",Apr 2010,Points: 5,4.639705882352941

Bouldering, top rope, lead...All fine. I suppose if someone is looking closely enough, they could see a slight shift in my breast location as I'm really engaging my pecks, but especially with a sports bra/top generally compressing things, it's nothing weird or obvious looking. I don't feel something strange happening, experience discomfort, get distracted, or anything like that... In terms of having to 'fix' implants eventually due to exercising... all implants should be replaced eventually. They have a lifespan, and are not meant to be permanent, so that just feels like a load of baloney to me. I think the most important thing would be taking care during recovery not to use the muscles too soon/too much because then you run the risk of displacing the implants while your bodily structure supporting them is still healing. So you're probably looking at taking a good 6-8 weeks off climbing while you heal and then listening to your body and taking it easy while you build back up.I hope this is helpful to anyone else who happens upon this looking for answers.

114374279,"May 16, 2018",Leron,"Pregnancy:  My wife climbed till 8 months and then started again about 1 month after.  We got a full body harness and that was pretty critical.  By 6.5-7 months she would down climb rather than being lowered as the harness was not supper comfy. She did limit herself to top rope for most of that time. It was less fun to climb pregnant and she did lose about two letter grades from her climbing for about 4 months after, but overall she stated that it wasn't too bad.  Other conditions of pregnancy were a much bigger factor than the effect on her climbing.Toddlers:  I will second the pack and play.  The can't walk good stage is harder but not bad if you have flat areas near by.  I never found the need to climb separate of my wife but we only have one kid and I was ok when others freaked out as my toddler put rocks in his mouth.  I find a tablet with games and a few downloaded movies to be very helpful for this stage.Kids: Now my kid is 5 and climbs some easy multi pitch with me on rest days.  He loves to swing from the rope on hard sport days.  He has grown up outside and loves to play in the dirt.  I have gotten my share of dirty looks as he tends to throw rocks (now in a safe direction at 3 not always).  I have been told he shouldn't move the rocks around it could cause erosion or you should have him leave the area as you found it.  Other climbers that don't have kids may complain when they show up at the crag and see your kid there.  They will likely teach your kid words that you would prefer them not to hear.  So far the kid only uses the words we do and doesn't seem to pick up on those used by the other climbers, which is a surprise as they are used often. He also likes to play guns and this makes a lot of climbers talk down at you for not discouraging it more.  I guess my ramblings are to point out our biggest issue with taking the kid climbing is not his ability to hike or his need for attention or even the increased stuff you will have to carry to the crag.  It is the less than chill back seat parents at the crags.  I was shocked to find a bunch of self proclaimed laid back climbers that have never had kids so vocally try to push their values and perceptions of parenthood on your family.Working a full time job:  As you get older, you will likely find that climbing hard for more than 3 hours a day 7 days a week becomes difficult not due to time, but due to physically recovery time increasing. Sucks to get old. I can only climb hard every other day now. I have plenty of time for a 40 hour a week job (I call this recovery time).  I also have found a second job on the side still doesn't cut into my climbing time. I did give up watching a lot of TV and video games.  If climbing is a priority it is easy to fit it in.Climbing Hard:  This is a very ambiguous term.  I wouldn't say that myself or Ken climb hard because that is always a grade or two above your current level. We try hard and have both gotten stronger since having kids.  My wife has also gotten stronger since having a kid. Having kids is not the limiting factor although it may be a weak excuse used by some. ",7,Unknown Hometown,Feb 2016,"Points: 1,131",4.035772357723578

114374279,"May 16, 2018",Lena chita,"A very wise woman once told me: ""Sure, you can have it all! Just not at the same time.""Pregnancy: I didn't climb through pregnancy, I was not a very serious climber at the time, I had no climbing partner support system, and I had other things going on. In 4 months after giving birth I defended my PhD, moved to another city, and started a new job. But a lot of women do climb and have no problem. You can keep climbing until the day you go into labor... and I know multiple women who climbed regularly, and fairly hard ( though not hard relative to their-pre-pregnancy level). It doesn't require much time-management at this point.But climbing through pregnancy will do very little to maintain your climbing fitness level long-term. You should climb if it feels good to go outside, hang out with your husband/friends, and move your body on the rock. However, if you don't feel like doing it... your climbing will recover back to your pre-pregnancy levels just fine, even if you do take the entire time off. You just have no idea how you would feel. A friend of mine (a 5.12 climber) was very intent on climbing as much as possible through pregnancy, but found out that her energy levels and motivation just weren't there, so she went climbing a few times when she felt like it, but mostly didn't climb. 4 months after giving birth she sent her first-ever V7. Another friend was really invested in climbing through pregnancy, and found out that due to joint laxity and pelvic pain she was in pain just walking, and climbing was unthinkable. She's had two kids now. She is back to crushing, climbing harder than she did before pregnancy.Babies/toddlers: If your husband/SO is a climber, and psyched on it, you will get plenty of climbing, and it won't be too bad. Especially with just one kid. Yes, you will have to pack a lot more shit, and you will choose climbing areas based on ease of approach, good place to let the kid play safely, and you will need a third person to help manage the little ones. I've seen that some people actually become better climbers when they go from a lackadaisical attitude of ""oh, we'll go whenever, no need to plan in advance"", and realize that they have to plan/schedule things.Indoor climbing is easy to manage, especially now that a lot of gyms have childcare. But you might have to make adjustments. if you are used to climbing with your husband, you might have to each find another partner, so you can go climbing at different times, while the other parent is watching the kids.IMO how far you live from climbing and how far you have to drive with the kids would be one of the biggest deciding factors for outdoor climbing. It's not the day at the crag that is the hardest thing to manage with kids. It's the drive to and from. if you have to drive 5-6 hrs now, that would turn into 7-8 hr drive with a baby/toddler. And you just won't do this more than once a month, if that much. If you are 45 min away from climbable rock, no big deal.Again, you don't know how you would feel. You might be super-psyched about climbing and getting back in shape, or you might find out that the motivation is just not there and you don't want to try hard. Right now you think that climbing is the most important thing, but you might find that you feel differently after you have a baby. I know women who bounced back within months, and I know women who had couple years of climbing at a mellow level and less frequently than before, but not feeling particularly bad about it, and who rallied back and re-discovered their psych when the kids were 4-6yo. I also know women who just faded from climbing and relegated it to the "" fun thing I used to do before kids""... it could happen to you, even if you don't think so right now, and you might not even feel bad about it... or you might.I started climbing seriously after my younger was born, and finding psych wasn't a problem. But yes, I only climbed outside once a month during her toddler/preschool years, which realistically meant maybe 6 weekend trips at year, by the time you take weather into account. At the time, as a newer climber, it felt like plenty. You might find yourself changing what kind of climbing you do. Maybe you used to be a trad climber, all about long multi-pitch. And you switched to single-pitch sport until you are comfortable leaving the kids with soemone for the weekend on a regular basis. You mgiht be a sport climber, but may choose to switch primarily to bouldering because of the logistics. Older kids: everyone thinks that by the time the kids would be older (school age) the climbing would be a breeze. While yes, you no longer have to worry about them walking off a cliff, or have to take them potty and deal with temper tantrums, this introduces a different challenge, and the one I was not prepared for, personally. My kids do not climb. Oh, I tried. And they tried. If things were different, my daughter might even have gotten into climbing more seriously, but she didn't. So as they got older, they had other activities, and they wanted to do other things. The weekends became about gymnastics competitions, robotics tournaments, and such. I was able to climb more during the week, but the weekends were still tough. If you kids climb... sounds perfect! Except if they become serious about it, your personal climbing goals might take a back seat to their projects. Pretty much the ideal scenario is the kid who likes to climb, but casually/just a little, and who is not involved in any sports that require weekend events.

You may discover that watching bugs is the best way to spend your afternoon, rather than get a haircut or whatever.As far as I'm concerned, kids belong outside. Period. Digging in the dirt and climbing trees should be in a kids bill of rights somewhere. I am the third person, with my climbing partner, his wife, and two kids, now and then. It's less climbing, but one parent is always right there when the kids need attention. Sometimes, that's a lot longer than you'd think. My opinion is the belayer needs to concentrate on belaying, a parent, on parenting, unless the third is interchangeable with the parents. I am not, and, don't wish to be. I am more than happy to be that third person, though, and their kids are great.Best, OLH",1,"Boise, ID",Aug 2015,"Points: 1,374",4.5550660792951545

Plenty of good info here already. I TR Solo or Lead Solo while my son stays home with my GF and I make sure to leave very early so when I get back it is not too long after he woke up. If you go as a group you have to be very mindful of them the entire time, which is very tough when your pushing bad beta and something you really want to send. I take him out randomly when he is up to it, but it is a snails pace to teach him and to set everything up so be prepared to become a guide/instructor. I took years off with other interests (school, peakbaggin, college football, women) so don't be afraid to do the same; If you truly want to climb you will come back to it or find a way to never stop. ",1,"Kennewick, WA",Mar 2018,Points: 808,3.893617021276596

Thankfully now we got 1-2 hr nap. I could lay her down in the crib but sometimes she had to be held so depends on the temperament of your child. She is now 20 months and we haven’t taken her climbing outside yet… best climbing is 2 hrs away so we just get grandma and grandpa to watch her once a month for us for a weekend get away. We do have a rock wall at home tho and she loves to climb on it. I suggest exposing them early to climbing on holds is important. We have had kids come over to climb on our wall at 2-4 yrs old and be too scared to do it…but again we got lucky with a fearless child…. Good and bad. Bad part is we really have to keep an eye on her outside! Also start showing the harness to them young.

I’m 5’1” with a short torso: the space between my lowest floating rib and my hip bone is only about an inch and a half standing as tall as possible. My size small women’s harnesses feel most safe with the belt cinched at my true waist (pretty high). But when I hang or fall, the waist belt compresses hard on my lowest floating rib, and I actually now have an intercostal cartilage injury from repeated rib compression from my harness. I’ve tried wearing it lower, on my hips like low-rise jeans, but I feel I’m getting pulled upside down when I hang. I try to cinch down the leg loops around my upper thighs but invariably even loops with adjustable buckles will ride up to my crotch. For a better visual, I’m one of those people who the high-waisted mom jean does NOT flatter because the space between the waist and my bra is like a pale slice of pink skin. Regular waist is high waist for me and low rise jeans (think 4in) look like normal jeans. Has anyone else had this issue with their harness? How did you sort it? I’ve tried mammut, black diamond, ocun, petzl, and a metolius safe tec so far. I’m considering trying a men’s harness. Perhaps the rise is too big on women’s harnesses.

When the nurse came back to check on me—several minutes later than she hoped—she immediately grabbed an epi pen because she thought I was going into anaphylactic shock.They put me on some made-for-me shots that needed to be taken 2-3x week, only at their office, only on certain days, and only during certain hours. The process is onerous. I eventually stopped going.I found that Flonase works very well for my (very significant) symptoms. I’ve turned several other people onto it have also had great success. It's OTC and there are several generics available; I buy the Kirkland brand at Costco.I think just about any allergy doc can give you a test to determine your allergens.

122060850,"Mar 19, 2022",Old lady H,"Thanks for the replies!Liz, a mastectomy of any sort is way worse than breast reduction, in more ways than one. I hope you're good now, and stay good for many years to come! I'll likely be back to activity in only a few weeks, and climbing she's saying wait 6 weeks, only because of a concern for falls. LL2, this is something I thought about for years. It is only very recently that money became available to actually consider it. Since you asked nicely, here's a long winded reply. A ""welcome to my world"", and, hey, points for trying to fathom it.The heart of your question, seems to be, is it worth spending money on old people for just quality of life stuff. How many years of benefit justify that waste of resources?Yeah, I'm phrasing it harshly, but it's part of the world we live in. Old becomes throwaway. Women have been lesser citizens. Our mastectomy patient upthread? It's only recently reconstructive surgery had any insurance coverage. Breasts aren't a medical necessity, right? And yes, this is usually, but not always, done by younger women. Surprisingly often, it is to remove implants. That says a lot of not great things about the values placed on women's bodies, imo. For me?Yeah.It becomes not, would this make my life better, enhance the quality of whatever years I have left (an absolute yes), but, sadly, the head game question ""am I worth it"". Make no mistake, this is entirely my decision, and the ""me"" I would choose to be. At 65? I've had a lot of decades of all decisions being provisional. Always considering others, quite often all those others topping the list to consider, and even trumping my own best interests.Yes, I can live with it, this body, as is. But why should I, if I don't have to do that anymore?It's a fork in the road. Choose to chase whatever possible self I can reasonably pursue, in the time I have left. Muddle along as is and try to make the best of whatever. Or just give up, eat cheesecake, sit in front of Netflix and be a standard issue old lady.Becoming a climber late in life is the first time I have ever had even a taste of athleticism. I was activish, rode a bike, gardened, stuff like that, but nothing remotely like actually expecting a body to perform. I have parts I never knew existed! The boobs literally get in the way. If I continue to push my arthritic knees into getting toward a high step....my leg will encounter my chest. If I aim for full rom on the rower? My knees hit that same doorstop. I have to lean over to see my feet....or my tie in knot. So it's a yes, pretty much. Met the surgeon this week. Now it's the who knows how long wait to hear from them to schedule the surgery for who knows when. In the meantime?I need to get my act together, lol!If I drop that much coinage for this, hey, get those new boobs the best body I can, eh?But even if I end up just muddling along, at least I'll be comfortable, and able to have clothes that fit. Not have runny sores in the cleavage swamp in hot weather. Lay down flat on my stomach. It'll be interesting to see if the furrows on my rib cage go away. I know the shoulder ones won't. That help you understand, LL2? If you're a ""fan"" (that's really sweet, thank you!), you probably have noticed I am always all in for talk, each helping the other to understand. Thanks for asking! I'm far from the only woman making decisions about her body. That is actually how most of us have lived a large part of our lives, being far too aware of how we look to others, and how we don't stack up. That isn't as bad as in the past....but it's still there. Oh! That's the last part of this. It is a ""vote"" for women making choices for their own bodies for their own reasons. Gee. Such a radical.....Best, Helen",29,"Boise, ID",Aug 2015,"Points: 1,374",4.386396526772793
122060850,"Mar 19, 2022",LL2,"Appreciate it, Helen. I am a gray hair too, though ten years younger than you. When I said ""at your age"", I meant our age really. Any woman I know who had a reduction only did it because of pain issues, so I never considered doing it by choice to ""get things out of the way"", haha. My gut gets in the way of my high steps sometimes. I guess I also maybe perceived it as a procedure that is more invasive than it is, and that too was part of my question of whether it's worth it. All surgeries have risk, and it's hard for me to wrap my head around going under the knife by choice. And of course there's risk in everyday life. I don't telemark anymore, nor do I highball boulder. I figure my knees have made it intact this far so why tempt fate? For me a life quality decision. Some people go all out until something explodes but I've chosen not to. But I still get out and sport and trad climb and do the occasional big runout, so I haven't totally become risk averse.I had a TIA (mini-stroke) almost two years ago. No worse for wear. I don't give it a lot of thought, really, it was just a random thing that happened. It's not like I was a walking time-bomb. I take some meds to this day. They had me wear a heart monitor for a month right after. In the end, they said I had an ever-so-slight irregularity to my heart beat, but also that my heart stopped beating for 6 full seconds, at a time when I know full well I was drinking a beer with my partner after a particularly runout day at Tres Piedras. I felt nothing. Cardiologist wanted to give me a pacemaker. I said no way.First, I don't believe my heart stopped. Those damn sensors were hell in the summer. While they never came off while sweating and climbing, the kind of rubbery pad they attach to turned to gel on particularly hot days. They gave me a tremendous allergic skin reaction but that's another story. I told the cardiologist that I thought it was a bogus reading and there's no way I was going to let them install a pacemaker over that. My father was told he needed a pacemaker at a similar age to me and it caused nothing but trouble for the rest of his life. I have to point out that the cardiologist was somewhat shocked when I told him I went climbing the weekend after the TIA, lol. He was like ""you really shouldn't do that at all, ever"". He clearly doesn't understand.The point of telling my story is that I am averse to invasive procedures. For me, getting a pacemaker for a slight heartbeat irregularity and a likely bogus reading would be an unnecessary invasive procedure that I would worry could potentially impact my quality of life. I know it's not particularly invasive these days compared to when my dad got his, but my perspective is why start tampering with my heart if I don;t need to? I guess I viewed a breast reduction sans back pain in the same way. But you have educated me that some procedures might enhance quality of life, and I hope it does for you.

Yeah, I parked this in the W's forum, but it certainly can apply to guys too.My surgeon was selected because this is her specialty, breasts, and, she does reconstructive surgery. That is something mastectomy patients weren't offered, bitd, because breasts weren't considered a medical necessity. You were considered maimed, so who cares, right?Anyway, my surgeon has indeed seen men in her practice! We talked quite a bit during the initial consultation. She is a long term surgeon here, cancer and otherwise. Dudes do get breast cancer, after all. People forget that.My surgery will be the keyhole type, with the possibility of a nipple graft too, if there's too much to remove and she has to move the nipple too. She was super to talk with, and honestly, probably knows what I will like more than I do, lol! She instantly cupped her hands, showed me her thoughts on it, and wow.

122060850,"Nov 3, 2022",Old lady H,"11/3/22 UPDATEI had breast reduction surgery 10/19, paid out of pocket. A few random bills out there still, but not much.All went as expected, and everything is looking good, literally and figuratively.Because I was huge and wanted modest, it worked out in surgery that a free nipple graft would be needed. That means a cautious recovery. So, had an appointment today. It's pretty much don't do much of anything until she sees me the end of November. Walking, maybe no hands light aerobics in another week or so. But just not much, really.That's the hard thing, and ties into my only ""complaint"" with my team. Even though the fact that I am on an antidepressant med was duly noted, and considered for the anesthesia/med package, the reason I was on the antidepressant was never part of the conversation. I was totally unprepared for the fairly hefty mind fuck from the general anesthesia days after the surgery, when I was on my own. Big depressive hit, plus, my sleep schedule was really messed up. Slept very little these 2+ weeks, and it's only just now easing back to normal.The other tough part is losing my physical activity. I've relied on doing stuff as a big part of managing depression, and, I have been managing really well.Until the physicality was taken away. I'll adapt, but I do wish it had been discussed beforehand!Just bumping to update, and hopefully this helps others too, now, or down the road.Best, Helen",15,"Boise, ID",Aug 2015,"Points: 1,374",4.800813008130081

I think about the various meds and how they interact.Anesthesia itself can cause depression, and being a depressive increases the odds of it.  Antidepressant meds are a consideration for all the other stuff that is associated with surgery, before, during and after, which is also a part of it.There's the emotional aspect post surgery, but that's not what I'm talking about. For me, it was having all the circuit breakers flipped to ""off"", then bringing the systems back online, and dumping a bunch of brain drugs into the equation. The reboot was mostly fine....except for a pretty hefty depressive hit, and, my sleep got really messed up. I'd sleep a couple hours, then wake like it was morning. So I'd go through my ""bedtime"" again (sit up, turn on the light, read a bit), and, another ""night"" of sleep. Again, 1-3 hours. The first week I averaged less than 4 hours per night. My sense of time was wildly off, especially what day it was, or even if it was another day or not. It's getting closer to reasonable now, 2+ weeks out. The super interesting thing was that it was unlike other times I've had little sleep. Somehow, my brain just decided a tiny amount of sleep was good. I googled pretty much everything and everything, all the symptoms, all the drugs, and all the combinations, lol! Depression can put you at greater risk in general, and antidepressants can multiply the effect of a lot of the other stuff. Like I said, the dosing part was considered....but not the actual depression. It's still some other department or something. Dunno. I did forgo the narcotics they sent home. But one bad night I knew they were there, waiting in the next room. Anyway, geez, you kinda had a run of stuff! Hope all goes well going forward! And yeah, you are a drug trial of one, so pay attention and be careful. For example, garlic was on the list of stuff to avoid in the week or two or three before surgery! It not only keeps platelets from attaching to each other it can dissolve platelets that are blobbed. Great for heart health, not great if you don't wanna bleed a bunch.Now, it's pretty much just the tedium of being very cautious not to strain anything.

If they just made them in women's sizes it would be so great. I've looked at kuhl's women's line and was suggested when messaging them was told that the closest was the kliffside https://www.rei.com/product/112451/kuhl-kliffside-convertible-pants-womensI have other problems with sizing (I'm closer to 5' so even the petite sizes for outdoor pants I usually have to hem), and they didn't have a petite version. But even if I could hem them, I was really wary about the photos, when you look at the pocket design it looks just as bad as every other women's pants out there (i.e. they don't look like they fit enough stuff compared to the men's version. I think one of my friends also complain about the prana halle(?) pants zip pocket on the side being ALMOST big enough for a phone, but just too small). In general, my phone is always in danger of falling out of my pockets, because women's clothing is not made with functional pockets. I've seen some guys pockets fit like, a disposable water bottle and then some ?? You have enough space for a phone and a wallet (and keys)??? You even have TWO pockets and then some, and you could fit TWO wallets and phones and keys (like, to carry your girlfriend's in addition to your own, because she doesn't have pockets).

Most of what I see are ski pants, and those tend to have voluminous legs (not so great for watching your feet) and internal gaiters (overkill). I've had to resort to altering every pant I buy. And it's not a simple matter of hemming them, because the bottom of the pant usually has (or should have) crampon-proof Kevlar kick patches and a zipper. I cut off about 6"" below the knee and sew 'em back together again. PITA!Probably not a gender-specific issue, though.

European brands fit me better than American brands.I’m the opposite of “curvy”, 5’2” with wide lats, nonexistent breasts, and 26in waist/35in hips. I climb in leggings, bc pants don’t fit. I can hardly ever find the sizes that fit me in brick-and-mortar stores. Sports bras are a big struggle. I used to always climb in tank tops with built-in shelf bras, perfectly adequate for me, bc I don’t really need any “support” for my chest. Patagonia, Stonewear Designs, Mountain Hardwear, Smartwool, and a bunch of other brands had them, at one point. But not anymore. Unfortunately now all the brands in unison have stepped away from built-in shelf bras, and the current style is to have a sports bra with pretty straps on the back, and a very lightweight tank that can’t be worn on its own, without a sports bra.  I have no trouble finding tanks that accommodate the lats, bc they are now lightweight and looser-fitting (la Sportiva is really killing it with their tank tops right now, lightweight, comfy, great colors that are bright, but not “girly pink and purple”). But that sports bra that needs to go under the tank… ugh! I’m pretty close to saying screw it, I’m going bra-less, and if it looks weird, so be it. As far as pants go, the E9 pants are the only one I found that fit me, but they keep changing their styles every 6 months, and the sizing varies greatly from one model to another, so now that my favorites are completely worn own, I will have to order every model, try them on, and hope that at least one fits… then would have to pay to return the rest.  North Face seems to be designed for people with arms and legs at least 6 inches longer than mine.Outdoor research thinks “tent-like” is a style of choice. Recently ordered an echo long-sleeved tee, and echo tank, in the same size as the old echo top I had. The shirt is a lot longer/looser than my old top, and the sleeves are longer, too, but still ok, I kept it. The tank… I dunno, if I take the waist in by about 10 inches, it would be perfect. Patagonia is going more and more “lifestyle”, and less and less technical, and also changing the fit to be more and more “roomy”. I don’t know what I would do when my old R1 (12 years old at this point) bites the dust. Rab is my favorite down jacket, and an old Patagonia nano-puff. But they are making those Nano-puffs more and more stylishly-fitted. Don’t need that! don’t get me started on climbing shoes and harnesses…I think the bottom line is that no matter what size you are, you have to try a whole bunch of things, before you find what fits",3,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.412731006160164

Or is there a better option for women that I'm not aware of?I hate to start a new thread on a topic I know has been covered before, but the existing threads I see look to be posted by folks who have just started climbing, or are climbing pretty soft (more power to them, you go, ladies!).I'm solid in the 5.11 range, breaking into 12s, and have never really trained before. I hangboard when I feel moved to, but it's been irregular at best. My most consistent ""training"" has been in the form of mobility work.

Based on what I think I know, that makes now a good time to get into a three month cycle. So please!

122971104,"Sep 5, 2022",Shaya C,"Hello! I noticed nobody had responded to this. I am no professional, mostly have done a lot of reading to structure my own training. Less so for climbing hard sport, more on the endurance side.Three-month (or 12 week) cycles are based on the concept of periodization. I don't think 12 weeks is necessarily a magic number-- depending on the training activities and goals, you can periodize over 8 or 16 or 20 weeks, or for months. Periodized plans are usually structured in cycles of 4 weeks because you spend three weeks building, then have a deload week. It's more about how you structure and what you do in those 12 weeks than the fact that you're training for exactly 12 weeks. (I also assume 12 is standard in part because it's a reasonable length for most people to commit to while also seeing gains. But that's just a guess--I'd be curious to hear from someone who knows more about this!) If you have almost exactly 3 months before your trip, then just choose or create a plan and go for it! I think the Rock Climber's Training Manual has examples of a 12 week plan in it. I'm sure there are dozens of others you can find, too. As far as women-specific advice, there is some research on working with your cycle. I'm not super familiar with it or if anyone is doing this with climbing-specific training. But I'm of the mind to monitor your energy levels, listen to your body and work with that. I find I'm more scared (head game is real) before my period and super energized right after my period. One strategy is to work with a 12-week periodized plan but plan it in a way that makes your biggest training weeks land during times of the month when you feel your best. If you're not sure when those times are, then this could be a good experiment in training and something to learn along the way. No matter what, if you stick to a training plan for 12 weeks you'll still likely see gains by the time you go to Tonsai! ",2,Unknown Hometown,Aug 2020,Points: 0,4.401685393258427

So I am thinking about using a heavy dose of sarcastic sweetness or some other non-confrontational approach instead. Case in point, I felt someone was being super rude to my partner as a leader so I confronted him (and there is zero chance he would have treated a dude this way), and in the end it made my partner more upset than the rude dude. But if my partner first throws the verbal punch, I will be a 100% in in that fight.

As one of my female climbing partners said, ""I love climbing, becasue I can check out all the sexy back muscles.""With that in mind, and as a married fifty-year old man with an adolescent daughter, it would be somewhat weird for me to invite a women on a climbing trip, overnight, weekend, or whatever.  I've done so--I've invited women to climb, and I've had some great days out--but it's also always a little strange.  One has to navigate difficult terrain: ""Does she think I'm hitting on her"""" and, ""He's inviting me to climb, but does he want to get into my pants?"" and so on.  It introduces an element that makes things hard, or fun, or exciting, or scary, or tedious, or whatever, depending on the relationbship between the people involved, and how they view each other.  This this added factor, alone, might explain some of why it's less common for platonic male-female climbing partnerships to develop.  To be clear, I'm not saying that competent, badass women climbers don't get ignored and overlooked--I ithink that they certainy do--I just think we need to acknowledge the above, as well. A related point: The ""stick clip guy"" comment seems patronizing and condescending, but it also seems a little sad, specially if it was actually meant as a pick up line, however akward or misplaced.  I've always thought of this as fundamentally unfair (and this goes all ways, man-woman, woman-made, same-sex, and so on. If the person making an advance is attractive to the recipient, then almost anything they say will be acceptable and perhaps welcome. In contrast, if the person making an advance is not attractive to the recipient, then almost anything they say will be judged as disgusting and annoying. Back to stick clip guy, let's suppose somebody in the group (man or woman) found him attractive and love blossomed.  Then his comment would be a cute piece of flirting, part of the history of their getting together, and not a sexist error.  More generaly, why should we assume that the crag, or anywhere, is a ""safe"" place where humans are not also be looking for love, flirting, meeting, and so on?  Are there any places that are safe from this basic natural human interaction?  Should there be?Does this make sense at all, or am I way off base?  All best.Lol!Climbing should teach all of us to operate outside of the normal box, just to stay alive.Both parties need to speak up, make expectations clear. Not just the is this a date thing, but risk tolerance, abilities, camping okay (or not), what approach is okay.....on and on.If you can't do that, get over how we so often just sidestep anything like this in day to day life, well, expect difficulties.Hopefully nothing that kills you or your partner.As to stick clip guy?My smart ass self would be kind....but still smartass. Give them an overly caring sympathetic look perhaps, tell them we usually climb past the first bolt, so sorry you can't, wanna turn on top rope once our rope's up? Or is this still too hard for you?   Then, I'd cock my head to one side, raise an eyebrow, and they'd get the ""really????"" expression. Followed by true nice, if they looked chagrined at all.If they got pissed off, chose to verbally escalate?Well, yeah, even Old lady H has been known to be decidedly unkind on occasion.My favorite comeback, never deployed in climbing, I must say, I actually have run into very little nonsense, and, people learn extremely quickly that I don't take crap, or want anyone just jumping in, without asking if I want help. Including internet warriors speaking for me when I'm totally capable of that myself. And enjoy it.Anyway. Best comeback was asking someone if they were born this stupid or it took them all their life to get to this point of idiocy. That, pretty much burns the bridges thoroughly.As an old lady, myself and my peers all faced far worse than anything anyone has mentioned in here, in climbing contexts. And, that included trying to make a living, when your paycheck was at risk if you didn't just quietly take whatever was dished out, including demands.Lots and lots of that, unfortunately. Still, although not nearly as bad as in the past.Part of what gave birth to the women's forum, iirc, was some pretty rowdy threads regarding not just sexism, but sexual harassment and assault in climbing.

122142937,"Aug 23, 2022",Lena chita,"I missed this thread on its debut, and now it looks to be well underway to a dumpster fire. Anyway, back to the OP, how I deal with it depends on the situation. If it is rudeness/condescension/machismo, I just respond to specifics, keep the interaction minimal, and stay polite. I don’t think there is anything gained by directly calling out the person, even if I think that sexism specifically is the reason for the guy’s attitude. E.g. “I’ll be your stick clip” guy would get back something neutral, like “thanks for the offer, but there is no need, I can put up my own”.Sometimes I just let the situation resolve itself. E.g. one time when I was climbing with another woman, a few guys walked up to us while we were just finishing the warmup climb. They wanted to get on the same route after us, and we offered them a stick clip, since they didn’t have one. The guy responded by saying, “nah, if you ladies can do it, I’m sure we would be fine”. The start is actually cruxy, but I had it dialed. My friend and I exchanged a private raised eyebrow, didn’t say another word. The first guy that confidently went up landed on his butt in a mud puddle from 10ft up, knocking down his belayer in the process. Then they wiped off their wet asses, and sheepishly asked for a stick clip,, accompanied by “wow, you ladies are stronger than you look! You really made it look easy”.  Still condescendingly-sexist, but they were also new…  hopefully a few more experiences like this will teach them not to make assumptions, and I don’t need to rub more mud into their already-muddy backsides, or rub their noses in it.Same with the guys who immediately jump on the same route that I’m working on. Sure, often it’s because they assume that the route must be easy. But sometimes it is because they see me trying interesting sequence, and genuinely get excited to have company to try the route with. If it’s the guy making assumptions based on my gender, I don’t need to thump his nose by telling him he’s a sexist idiot. The route would smack him down soon enough. And if it’s the latter option— I’m happy to have company, too! There is a small minority of situations where I would address the sexism directly, usually by asking, “what makes you say that?” or “why would you think that?” (E.g. a guy saying something like “you are probably looking for that one”, pointing at the easiest no-star route at the wall, when he sees me consulting a guidebook, while asking him if he knows the name of the route he is setting up to climb.) It is kinda funny to see them squirm, trying to answer that. Sometimes it’s nice to have an ally. E.g. when a guy addresses the questions about a route to my husband, because he assumes that if we are the only two people at the crag, and there is a rope hanging, it must be because my husband put up the rope for me to TR, my husband would always say, you should ask my wife, it’s her warmup, she knows this route much better than I do. Sure, I don’t need “saving”, but it is nice when a guy highlights assumptions made by another guy, and does it in a way that would, hopefully, make it less likely that the guy would jump to the same conclusion in the future. Ultimately, the only way to break stereotypes is to show that you don’t fit a stereotype. If enough people don’t fit, the stereotype weakens over time.",7,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.40194489465154

It's so easy to get discouraged and you so desperately want to get back to your life before baby. It's hard to slow down a little. What grade were you climbing out of curiosity? I started out with easier 5.6/5.7 routes and doing 2-3 laps maybe once a week starting at 8 weeks pp. I did climb until her due date and she came 2 days later so my guess is that helped keep me strong.

They have a new technology in their technician and solution harnesses that have 3 strands of wedding that are spread out in the leg loop and provide more comfort. I am really looking at this however the leg loops only extend to 26 inches. My thighs are about 28 inches. I wish not to purchase a man’s harness. I know I can lose a few inches but I don’t want to have to in order to fit into a harness. So the question is do any ladies out there have the solution harness with larger size thighs and is it comfortable?,0,Grand Rapids MI,Dec 2017,Points: 1,4.087301587301587

My biggest issues are that the waist belt doesn't adjust to be large enough to get on easily (especially if I'm layering up) and then it doesn't get quite small enough on my waist. My second issue is comfort - when I'm on take or just dangling while belaying after catching a fall, it rides way up into my ribcage area and it kind of hurts my tummy. I think that this issue might be the length between the waist and leg loops so it seems like the unisex Corax might be a good option.

122351944,"May 9, 2022",Zoe Stone,"https://climbingaway.fr/en/travel/climbing-guide-books/The above link is a list of guidebooks for different regions in Norway, which gives you an idea of where the climbing is.I don’t know how your Norwegian language is, so I don’t want to sound condescending, but ‘to climb’ is ‘å klatre’ in Norwegian. Locally, most outdoor sports have a club affiliated with them, and most of these clubs have a Facebook page and/or website. In Norwegian the climbing club is called a klatreklubb and will often revolve around the local gym but include beta on the area’s outdoor scene as well. So you can get a lot of good info by typing [your region]+klatreklubb into Facebook or google, i.e.https://www.facebook.com/osloklatreklubbhttps://osloklatreklubb.no/Use translate features if needed. I don’t know about Oslo, but in my area you can find partners and a lot of great local knowledge by just posting on the Facebook page. Don’t be afraid to post in English if you don’t know how to make your point in Norwegian - people will still understand you. Remember to establish what you plan on using for your climber/belayer communication when climbing with new partners. It can vary a lot across regions and languages.Some of the best climbing (imo) is up North and you can get round trip flights for as low as $50 from Oslo airport (or up to $200 depending on how early you book and how inconvenient of a flight you’re willing to take). From Oslo, you’re about 2hrs bus ride away from Bohuslän, a fucking paradise of single pitch trad in Sweden. They have a great guidebook too. It’s not in English but if you pick up a few key words you can make do. Climbing in Swedish is klättring. Sprick = crack, led=lead, vägg = wall.Hmu if you come North or have any other questions. ",2,"Narvik, NO",Sep 2016,Points: 0,4.912751677852349

I want to get more gear soon and would love to explore trad climbing.My boyfriend has introduced me to a lot of outdoor lead, trad, and multipitching and he has all the gear. We've been to Red Rocks, local crags, Rumney, Reimers Ranch in TX, and more. Very sadly, I do not have the opportunity to climb with him in the foreseeable future.I am searching for fellow female active adventurers in the area with a similar stoke for climbing that could potentially grow into a friendship/partnership. I understand this doesn't happen overnight. If you identify as female, are in the general Southeast MA (around New Bedford) area, and love to be active and outside, hit me up and let's see if we can do some climbing or frisbee or just hang out.",1,Unknown Hometown,Aug 2020,Points: 0,4.578125

Then it’s just one more thing you have to haul around with you on a multipitch, and that thing is also covered in your pee.I’ve been toying around with the idea of sewing an extended zipper that goes all the way along the crotch area of my climbing pants, that way I could keep my harness on and just unzip and pee. Alas, I’m lazy so this hasn’t happened yet.Honestly on sketchier ledges, I wrap my PAS or a sling around my waist and clip in direct to the anchor or whatever pro, that way when I take off my harness to pee I still have something anchoring me to the wall.

I can follow nearly anything, I have not climbed in a few months so I do plan to get back into it before summer to get back to these grades but winter skiing ad weight lifting has been on my mind more. Logistics: Based out of Seattle, can do the exits and Index during the week but prefer longer multi-pitch trad on weekends. I have a dog so when determining plans for a weekend has to be coordinated with a sitter or my partner. It can be done but I do lack full flexibility sometimes, I do my best to make it always work. I am not keen on flaky people as it does take work on my end to get that time off and find a dog sitter.Goals: longer WA alpine multi-pitch, some additional local Index routes.

I witnessed something today at the gym that got me thinking:There was a guy belaying a girl on the wall, and she was getting fairly high up. Instead of taking up the slack, her belayer was openly staring at her ass. She asked him to take up the slack and he did, but then did the same thing again when she got higher. The rope was pooling in her lap. She was like “dude! What are you doing down there?” But her back was to him, so of course she couldn’t see why he wasn’t taking up the slack. He laughed at her, took up the slack, and then proceeded to let it get loose again. She stopped climbing and got serious, telling him he needed to do better because she was going to get hurt if he kept leaving so much slack. He laughed again like he was teasing her and not putting her in danger.I guess I have a few questions based on this interaction:1) What would you do in this situation, as the climber or as a witness?

He decided we would just top rope some stuff. Same story as in the OP but all the slack was because he was checking out other women that were walking by on the carriage road. I did fall from about 15 feet up on a short route and decked with rope stretch (but really shouldn't have given how short the route was and how high I was). His only response was ""rope stretch"". Then he took his turn. He fell from a lower spot than I did and did not hit the ground. Not long after he turned to a party climbing next to us and said ""do you mind climbing with her the rest of the day?"" and then took off. I ended up having a great day with the other group. The other group did confirm his attention was firmly on other women and not on me who he was belaying.

If I perceive the amount of slack, or anything else in someone’s belaying dangerous, I would alert the gym staff, and let them observe/intervene. Rope pooling in lap was what? 3 feet? And at that point the climber was addressing the issue? Not exactly an emergency. Seems like the woman knew what she needed. As a climber in this situation, if a random new partner was leaving too much slack in toprope in the gym, I would not be immediately concerned, either. I would ask for up-rope, if I needed it, of course. And ask repeatedly, during that first climb, if I needed to. I would look down to see what he was doing, because if this is someone I have never climbed with, before, I would be climbing a very easy route, something where I could look down and observe.Beyond that, I would need more background, bc I actually have a hard time imagining a scenario in which I ended up climbing with this guy.Is he a brand-new climber, who asked if I might be willing to climb with him? when I look down, Is his belay stroke good, and he is just struggling to keep up? In that case, I might slow down, and see if that fixes things for now.Is this a guy who is not used to the gym rope double-wrapped around the bar? I know from personal experience that you can’t go by “feel” of the rope looseness with the stupid high friction, the way you would in normal toprope setup. So again, I would not immediately assume bad intentions on his part, and would simply ask for up-rope. But in this case I would expect to hear back something like “ugh, sorry, can’t feel the rope at all, my bad”. But if this happens several times in that first climb, and the guy laughs at me when I make it clear that I need him to keep less slack in the system… I’ll come down, and tell him thanks, but I’m done. ",7,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.327823691460055

As in outside observer, your read of the situation is not always accurate.For example, I have couple partners who do a lot of teasing and joking about penalty slack, and I respond in kind.

121906360,"Jan 25, 2022",Lenore Sparks,"Hi ladies, Why do you not ‘vote’ on a grade for routes you send?The overwhelming majority of people contributing to the opinions of routes here on MP identify as males. Women often contribute a tick and occasionally a star or five to a route, but hardly ever a suggested grade. Why? I have theories. One, MP is only for crusty old men haha  ! Another is that perhaps all women agree 100% on all of the routes’ grades. Unlikely! One male theorized that women don’t send and thus aren’t morally allowed to grade the route until they send... hmmm... again, unlikely! Are women too shy to grade routes? Do they feel like they will be scorned if they downgrade (poor male egos) or upgrade (will I be ridiculed and seen as not strong enough)? What are your reasons for NOT giving your public opinion on a route grade?Here is why I think it matters: your opinion is valuable information to climbers like me! I directly benefit from knowing who has climbed a route, and how hard they think it is. For example, in Eldorado Springs if Layton Kor (~6’5”) has the FA on a 5.11 R/X route and only people 6’4” and taller have repeated it, I’m not going to try that route. I’ve been sandbagged countless times on Kor routes, and though it is character building, it can also be dangerous. Nowadays, on all Kor routes, I add a full number grade to prepare myself for a realistic-feeling onsight attempt. However, if a shorter person or child left an opinion, I could more accurately gauge how that Kor route might feel for someone like me.Gauging climbing difficulty on hard trad lines is a realm where opinions are helpful. An excellent example is Sacred Cow, in Indian Creek. Steve Hong established the line at a whopping 5.13-. It has since been downgraded on MP to 5.12c, and as low as 12a by a lady in the comments section (note: NOT on the opinions... why?). 12a or 12a/b is actually a realistic grade for how it felt for me. I have perfect sized hands for this #0.75-#1 camalot crack. However, 13a is a very realistic grade for Dr. Hong or other males with gigantic hands and a solid rack of forged friends. This route, like many others, is graded by men and women on 8a, but this system is irrelevant considering it rewards climbers for difficult climbing, leading to inflation. Overall, in trad climbing, size matters and no matter what the suggested FA grade is, I only care about what people my size think. Typically, people my size  (I’m 5’2”) are ladies and children: the least frequent commenters on MP grades.I leave grade opinions on routes where someone small may find my input really interesting. I don’t grade every route I’ve sent. Sometimes, however, I’m by far the shortest or littlest person to have done a hard trad line, and often the grade does not reflect my experience. It’s close! But not exact. Therefore, I humbly ask the ladies here to vote on grades, not in the comments, but on the opinions option if your experience was different than that of the FA or of very large humans. Please leave me a comment below as to why or why not you vote. I’m simply curious!

My wife has discovered the power drill and put holes in every room now to hang shelves and photos. The act of drilling is not the obstacle. It's the physically easiest part of route development. Takes 30 to 80 seconds for 3/8 by 3 and 3/8 inch bolts on my local basalt. But I digress.My 10 year daughter is about 4 foot 10 inches and is getting more into climbing. In the gym, the setters tell me they make an effort to not have ""reachy"" moves that short climbers would get shut down by, so she can get up some 11s with no falls, and is mock leading 10s. But outside she can run into shutdown reach moves on a 5.8 So, is that route really 5.8 only if you are, say, 5 foot 2 or taller? Yeah yeah we all know Lynn Hill will get up the 5.8 by superior smearing and lockoff skills, but it might be harder than 5.8 for her all the same, so of course i tell my daughter she needs to use her feet differently (be like Lynn) or try using an unlikely intermediate (and yes it will seem harder than 5.8).Of course, it would be unmanageable and ridiculous to have multiple grades for each route depending on your height or - as said above - the width of your hands!

Would I up the grade for that? No, because I'm short, an outlier, even for women. It's still useful to know it will be a hang to clean situation if you are my height, and maybe a poor, or even dangerous, route to lead, with anchors needing a move or two more, where the holds may not exist, especially at the consensus grade for average dudes. Love those pics, too!Best, Helen",10,"Boise, ID",Aug 2015,"Points: 1,374",4.174107142857143

121906360,"Jan 25, 2022",Lora Durance,"My guess is that the majority of MP users are probably male, and so the graders are too. Here’s my personal experience with grading: As a 5’1” climber, I almost always upgrade. Sometimes I do it and feel strongly, other times I do it to fight the sandbaggers, but often I do it for the short folx. I have downgraded only once , and I confess I think the route just fit my body. But I didn’t start grading routes — and I especially didn’t start universally upgrading — until I started climbing 12s (an arbitrary mark of fitness in these parts) because I felt like an imposter. I’m guessing lots of people feel the same way. And so the folx who don’t feel like imposters, regardless of gender, will offer their opinions and their voices will be heard. This may be because they genuinely feel they deserve to have a voice because that’s what life has taught them. It may be because, due to their climbing prowess, they feel comfortable publicly owning their level of struggle on a climb because they otherwise feel like they’re considered strong. There may be folx who grade who don’t struggle with knowing their opinion will be public and thus subject to scrutiny, with their achievements open to judgement. I know I’ve watched my male climbing partner bolt and FA a route that’s out of my wheelhouse and then agonize over grading it because he doesn’t want it to be downgraded but also doesn’t want to look like a sandbagger. Climbing and egos are strange bedfellows and who can know exactly why? But I’m glad someone is bringing this up for us to talk about.

121906360,"Jan 25, 2022",Lena chita,"I go back and forth on this. I used to put the grade votes more often in the past. I rarely do now, unless my opinion is more than a letter grade off the consensus. I have both up- snd down- graded routes in the past.I don’t check the details of various route grade votes on MP, before deciding to climb the route, and, anyhow, unless I know the person who put in the vote, their grade opinion is not particularly useful to me. I would ask a personal opinion of people whose climbing style I know well, and who know my climbing, if I really wanted individualized advice.Otherwise, Consensus is good enough for a ballpark, and stakes are relatively low in single pitch sport climbing, which is the bulk of what I do. If I get on a route that is so much harder than the expected grade, that I simply cannot do it, I would stick clip, or leave a biner.I do think that the route grade input should be mandatory, if you want to add a tick, regardless of whether it’s a private tick, or a public tick. And I think the grade and quality votes should be anonymous. Redriverclimbing.com has done a good job with route grade/quality charts.

I'm sure they're out there, but still in the minority. So are women routesetters, guides, SAR, rope techs, arborists......still a minority. Trades, too. The super simple answer why? Those are all apprentice/mentor type ""jobs"", and often generational too. Previous generations, it was less common to do nontraditional things. Now? Have at it! But it takes time. If you never see someone like you doing something? That thought may never even enter your head to give it a shot. Once that lightbulb goes off?

Any way they want, partnered with anyone who's agreeable to it.And we'll all cheer when you try!I'm fine with leaving developing to who ever gets to it, and fine with consensus grading that could be ""skewed"" far away from my height, which is far off the bell curve. What it needs to do, is be appropriate to the other climbs in that area. It's up to me, to suss out a new place, get a feel for the grades, and perhaps even sort it out by FAs.

I do tend to avoid leading routes that say, ""harder for short people"". I'm 5'3"" with a -4 ape index so while I'm near average for height, I still can't reach a darn thing. On rock, I do get annoyed when a moderate 5.8 turns out having some obscure 5.10 intermediate move because I couldn't reach the nice jug, but what really really annoys me is...bolting. We all can probably agree that bolting is primarily male dominated, as is FAs and climbing in general.I'm primarily a trad climber mainly because there have been enough inaccessible/uncomfortable/dangerous bolt placements created with only taller humans in mind that have completely shut me down. If a 6'2"" tall human placed a bolt from a great clipping stance to protect a future crux move, and the bolt is simply at their face level, there's no way I'd be able to reach the hanger and pull the next crux moves safely. Sometimes the next move is also within decking or ledge fall potential, rendering the move dangerous if unprotected. Non-inclusive bolt placement also just makes the route less fun. Sometimes bolt placements are made due to rock quality, but more often than not, it's simply too high and moving it 6"" down is still in good rock. I guess this is a bit tangent to what your primary post is about, but I think it's still somewhat relevant. We need more diversity in people who route develop and route developers need to get a wider diversity of opinions before drilling into rock. It's probably worth writing a comment about, ""This route is bolted high"" - as a warning for shorter folks.A bit more on topic, your sentence: ""Do they feel like they will be scorned if they downgrade (poor male egos) or upgrade (will I be ridiculed and seen as not strong enough)? "" Strikes a chord: How many smaller folks on here, have sent a route that shut down larger folks (usually crimpy, roofs, small cracks) and have had their send attributed to them simply ""being smaller?"" Without trying to exclude non-binary folks, smaller people are typically women and larger people are usually men. What I observe a lot, is that if a woman can't send a route that a man can, she's typically just like ""damn, got to to get stronger"" compared to when a man can't send a route that a woman can. He is usually way more dismissive of her strength, ""You only sent that because you have small hands."" Nah man, she's also strong as fuck. Maybe some smaller people are so dismissed so they don't feel like they're allowed an opinion/rating/comment.Also, one comment that I absolutely hate is: ""Ah well Lynn Hill is only 5'2"" so you should be able to do it if you're short!"" Yeah man, Lynn Hill is also a professional climber and one of the 0.1% of all climbers. I'm a regular human trying to have a good time. Tommy Caldwell is your height, why can't you send the 5.14?That all said, I will definitely put more attention into rating routes as well as contributing to comments. I consume and highly value comments especially from smaller folks, I should contribute as well. I think you brought in some phenomenal points. Thank you for bringing this up.

That is all. A solution exists, so don't whine unless you have done the above and the FA still rejected the request!I agree that climbing isn't and shouldn't be 100% safe and there are many routes with runouts I won't accept, and won't do, which in its impact upon me is the same as not being able to clip a bolt I can't reach (i.e. I don't want to do the moves without a bolt clipped). I don't do those routes, that's all. None of us have the right to lead every route somebody else labored to put up.

Even better, could she post and share her first-hand experience? Could be poor harness fit, either wearing it incorrectly or just the wrong size or style for her body. Could be a combination of harness rise, belay loop size, and carabiner length all on the slightly longer side of the spectrum while her torso is on the shorter side of average… even her posture when catching falls can contribute to the geometry…  but what you noted about the whole harness riding way up makes me think it’s more likely poor fit. My harness fits well and I have a longer rise and shorter torso, add in the larger belay loop of my mm caddy and my belay device ends up around sternum height for me. One of several reasons I don’t extend. Near the face isn’t great, but I’d be more concerned about the harness waist not staying at her waist but perhaps riding up onto her diaphragm or ribs.

Women's harnesses are designed to sit higher on the hips than men's, but depending on her proportions, a men's harness might suit her body better. Maybe you work in the industry and have some special insight into this, but I would figure the opposite.   I don't think of harnesses as being designed to sit on the hips at all, the waist belt should sit on the narrowest part of your midsection, which is the (wait for it...) waist.  (Normal) Men's waist to hip ratio is about 0.9 (the waist is a little narrower than the hips).  Remember back when a ""harness"" was a swami belt of tubular webbing tied around your midsection  - it always was tied around the waist.  Otherwise if you flipped upside down, you could fall out of your harness.   Most women have smaller - sometimes much smaller waists than hips.  Thus, ""woman's"" harnesses are designed to have a smaller waist relative to leg loop diameter.  My waist is 29"" and my hips are 39"".  The only way to get a harness that properly cinches around my waist  and that also fits my hips and legs is to buy a harness with adjustable leg loops.  My impression is that women with straighter figures than mine and longer torsos can more get away with a man's harness or a woman's harness with non-adjustable leg loops.",2,Upland,May 2015,"Points: 1,097",4.563559322033898

121983677,"Feb 20, 2022",Old lady H,"In terms of finding a new harness, if there's not much available in Rexburg, just ask around at the gym. People are usually pretty nice about that sort of beta, and if someone is close to your height and proportions, they will be able to give you feedback on their harness. Probably let you try it out, too.Best, H.EDIT to add to the OP, does your partner care? Is she comfortable working the belay device and the harness is working for her? Why are you asking, and not her? If she pops on, that might be more helpful.Belay loops, carabiners and belay devices are all pretty much set sizes, some a bit larger or smaller, but not as variable as harnesses would be, so there's a certain minimum of space that rigging takes up, no matter what harness you are in. For me, at 4'11"", it ends up much higher than for most people. For that reason, I usually extend my rappels.  Climbing! Here's a photo, after the harness has been weighted. It's a CAMP Jasper, which has fully adjustable waist and leg loops (4 points to doubleback). The angle distorts things, but this is not unusual, to have the rigging way chest height.For the rope solo peeps? I had to get a single loop (like a belay loop) as the piece of rigging that made the heights work for the chest ascender (CAMP turbo) that's the top piece. No sling worked.

My issue lies in knowing what to place where when I'm in the moment on a hard bit, so I like to suss it out on top rope or go piece to piece until I feel fairly solid about what I'm going to do. I also stopped caring so much about onsighting - takes the pressure way down. Trusting my gear and the climbing itself for me are *usually* not the problem. I spend lots of mental energy on not fucking up my gear beta so I just feel better when I dial it in ahead of time and can have more fun with the climbing part. With more mileage my hope is that those .11's start to feel more like those .10's. Like the other ladies also said, trad grades are silly and can be totally dependent on the rock and size when it comes to crack climbing. My local crags don't have splitters, so it climbs more sporty but the gear is weird.

For a sport climber at a valley floor maybe not so much. Carbs utilize less oxygen than fats or protein and help you avoid fatigue on a long day in the mountains. At high elevations, the extra O2 might not be significant but there is a fine line that you cross at some point. Some can't make it past 12,000 ft. Maybe taters will get them an extra 200? Got me. Being a biochemist, you can probably do the math and fill us in. Near 14,000 ft, you got 42% fewer oxygen molecules in every breath & 9% or less in the blood, or something like that.

In particular, I am wondering if I have to use the battery to get reasonably warm with those options, since I plan to be out for about 7-8 hours at a time (beyond the battery life), or if they are cold without the battery.

The OR's are this way, you can see the little grippy parts on the fingertips of the liner, but I rarely did it - too much fuss. A separate liner also helps with drying. The liners in the RBH aren't really meant to be used alone, they're just interchangable. There are no grippy sections and the liner fabric isn't particularly burly. Your Mercuries also have a liner velcro'd in. At least mine do. It's a claw for dexterity but no grippy parts and fragile looking fabric. And a pain to remove quickly, 360 degree Velcro. I agree with you on liner gloves and warmth. A liner mitten wouldn't work with Mercuries even if you had extra room in there because of the trigger finger design. ",1,New England,Sep 2013,Points: 5,4.346153846153846

Hands lose a lot of heat from the wrist because blood vessels there are so close to the surface. A fuzzy wool sock adds insulation without compromising dexterity.

Again, take this with a grain of salt and if you're near a shop that carries them, it's probably worth a fit try on.The setup she really likes is a thin insulating Patagonia layer (I think it's the thermal weight Capilene bottoms) with La Sportiva Mantra pants for the exterior layer.

I wear them in a size 4, which is my normal size in most brands. I also tried on the altiva when I bought the simul, and I was concerned that the belt on the altiva would be uncomfortable with a harness. I've  owned a pair of gamma LTs in the past, which were lighter weight and seemed less durable as a result.

121889693,"Jan 21, 2022",Alyssa K,"I have the Gamma LT, and older version of the Simul Alpine, and the BD Alpine. You can cross the BD Alpine right off your list if you're ever planning to use them for winter sports or cool weather. Lower leg is too narrow to fit over boots, thin material, uncomfortable/lack of stretch, the material tears very easily, and the pockets are awful. I've found the Gamma LT to hit the sweet spot for winter use. Durable, just the right weight for high exertion winter activities (I usually layer with running tights), good pocket situation, nice belt. If you're planning to ski, getting pants with a lower leg zipper is key, otherwise they won't fit over ski boots. The Simul Alpine are great for shoulder season/alpine rock, but I'm not sure they're the best if you also want to use them for skiing and ice climbing. A little thin, no way to attach shock cord to the bottom of the pants to keep the cuff down when postholing, no waist adjustment (irritating on long days when the material stretches and starts to sag), no lower leg zipper. I also have the OR Cirque...they're a heavier material than all the others and have an odd velcro waist adjustment. They're ok for winter sports, but I'm not sure I'd want to use them for rock; they're a bit bulky and heavy. ",1,South Lake Tahoe,Mar 2014,Points: 46,4.510917030567685

121889693,"Jan 25, 2022",B S,"I also have the simul alpine! I like the fit, and I usually have trouble finding pants that fit my proportions (small waist, bigger butt). Was skeptical about them since the waist isn't adjustable, but the elastic portion in the back takes care of that. They're fairly stretchy except for where the leg zippers are (duh), but when they fit a little snugger on my thighs prior to losing a few pounds I found that a little annoying. The rise is higher than most soft shells I've tried on, and since the back rises even higher than the front it takes care of your lower back being exposed while sitting in your harness on the wall. The pockets on the legs are great for accessing with a harness on, though they could be a touch bigger in my opinion. The cinch around the ankle is great for climbing, but it also opens wide enough to fit over mountaineering boots (not sure about ski boots).In terms of use, I find them fairly thin on their own, but I've rock climbed in them with a thin layer underneath in 30-40 degree temps and was comfortable the whole time. I have ice climbed in them in the same temps as above, and I was comfortable with a wool layer underneath. For ice if it's below ~30, I go for a different soft shell. For durability, they've been great on rock, but while ice climbing I immediately put crampon holes in them without much effort, so you'd need gaiters in that case. If you are eventually looking for a soft shell that can be both a ski pant and an ice climbing pant, I like these from Mammut so far. They run small, but I've been ice climbing and skiing in them in low temps with no issues and the leg vents are great for long approaches where you're working up some heat.",0,Unknown Hometown,Apr 2021,Points: 0,4.3197492163009406

For me, acrobat work is a job, and I do it within a pretty organized structure — I train with a team and according to a performance calendar. Climbing is my life project, I work with a coach, but it’s much more important to me and is structured around a seasonal calendar over many years. I know that I care about climbing more and I accept that I have to sacrifice my development as a dancer for it. I have to be careful to keep my dance and acrobat ambitions modest. I am very deliberate about this, avoiding ambition in one and forcing myself to shift my attention, and I have to be, because climbing involves a lot of being alone and struggling and failing, and dancing on a stage involves a lot of people applauding me and me feeling really validated. It would be very easy to begin to favor the later. It’s also much, much gentler on my body. It is also simply easier, because nothing is harder than climbing. In terms of scheduling, I would say I give  one week per month to dance and acrobat training. I use this as an easy week or a deload week for my climbing (or climbing training), and when that week is over I either go to projects on rock or back into training depending on the season. It’s hard not to feel my attention drift back to dance, so I allow myself two dance drills during my warm-up for climbing training. But then I have to make a pretty strict division and shut the door for the rest of the session, and the week. I think the two activities have a nice complement to each other, but for me it would not be possible or interesting to divide my attention equally. I think if it is not obvious yet which one is more important to you, it will be within a couple of years. But I would suggest that when you do figure that out, be fully prepared to sacrifice the other and be content limiting your development in it. Or you may just not be somebody who feels drawn to full time crazy commitments like this and be happy forever doing both more casually.

I am in a wonderful relationship with a man I adore, but a big issue that's come up is that he doesn't share my love of climbing. We travel constantly and are on the road and I'm finding it very difficult to find a way to work in time to pursue climbing. Climbing to me is my passion and necessary for my happiness and mental health. We love spending time together, but despite my best efforts (including encouragement and even buying him shoes and harness) he has no interest in pursuing climbing.Does anyone else have a relationship like this?

You travel for work separately? Or you two are on a road trip together?Traveling certainly complicates things, because you need to find partners, and accommodate your SO at the same time.  What does your SO do for fun? What do the two of you do together? I don’t think it is super-onerous to ask him to come with you for couple hours of belaying once a week, if he enjoys hiking/bring outdoors, and you are visiting different places... and especially if you can also do something that he likes/wants to do once a week. And you should schedule climbing same as you schedule anything else important.

Let’s hear from the women. I do think that there are differences in this scenario, when the climber is a woman, and the non-climber is a guy, vs. the other way around. Some of them get exacerbated when the kids are involved. Others are independent of having kids.

His girlfriend comes along. She is a newer/occasional climber, and there is nothing for her to climb at this crag. But the guy is stoked, and so are his buddies. They set up toprope on the easiest climb at the crag for the girl when they climb it as their warmup, and then get on their project. She topropes it, with a lot of hanging, maybe once or twice. Or maybe they didn't even have that easy climb, and just tell her to get on the bottom of whatever they are working. She doesn't do well, climbing-wise, but she is fine with trying the bottom 10 feet twice, or not climbing at all. She has a tablet that she brought along, to help with the boredom. And she is having a good time, just hanging out there with her BF and his buddies, even if she is not climbing much.Have you often seen this scenario in reverse? A climber girl comes out climbing with her friends, and her boyfriend tagged along to just hang out at the crag and read a book?  Not because he is injured, or taking a rest day? (not impossible, but WAY more rare).I do know some women whose significant others are not climbers, just a couple of them. I know a lot more guys in this scenario. From this anecdotal sample group, it looks to me that women with non-climber male partners go on outdoor climbing trips less frequently than men whose female partners do not climb. That includes both the trips where the non-climber significant other stays home, and the trips where the non-climber significant other comes along.For the climber guys, their non-climber significant other comes along relatively often. Not always, mind you, but they certainly manage several times a year to do a ""hybrid"" climbing-and-other-stuff trips where the family comes along, and they do some kind of combination of the following, alternating things/mixing them up:-the guy climbs with other people while the girlfriend/wife (and kids) hang out at the cabin, or go shopping to nearby town, or go to see a movie-the guy takes a rest day from climbing, and does something with the family: kayaking, sight-seeing, hiking, heck, maybe a wine- or bourbon-tasting tour, etc.-the guy goes climbing and the wife/kids come along to the crag. there is maybe some easy climbing set up for kids and/or wife, and the guy maybe climbs couple pitches of harder climbing, if there are people around to belay him. Sometimes the wife even knows how to belay, and would belay the kids on  toprope, or maybe even belay him. They have a short day, with the primary goal of having the casual/occasional climbers in the group having a good time..For the women climbers with non-climber husband, this sort of trip happens MAYBE once a year, if that, not 3-4 times, as it does for the guys.  I am not saying that this is how things SHOULD be, that there is some innate biological reasons why they are the way they are.

We can never predict how things turn out and where life takes us long-term.On a personal level, I married my climbing partner. We were climbing partners for about 4-5 years before we started dating, and pretty much climbed almost exclusively with each other for the last couple years of that time, before we started dating. We started climbing completely independently from each other. So surely we were compatible climbing partners, and surely we both were really into climbing, and that wasn't going to change...Except my husband had a shoulder surgery. And while he has physically recovered fully, he never regained the same drive for climbing that he used to have. He still climbs, and we still have our climbing vacations, which I really love and enjoy. But I now go climbing on weekend trips without him as often as I go with him. if the weather isn't perfect, he doesn't feel like going. The Tuesday/ thursday night gym climbing that used to be set in stone is no longer set in stone for him, I might find that he is bailing on a moment's notice. And he has said that if he ever gets another major climbing-related injury that requires surgery, he is done with climbing... Certainly not something that I ever could have predicted or anticipated.Interestingly, even with a husband that is fully supportive of my climbing, and excited for me, and in no way stopping me from going on climbing trips, I find myself climbing less, now that he is climbing less.  ",24,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.93205574912892

All the guys I know with nonclimbing spouses travel, train, and climb much more than I do, as the climber with no climbing spouse.

That's the arrangement they've worked out, for whatever reason. Same for me, over the decades. Spouse has traveled the world, I take long weekends, lol!There are two parts to work out. First, is trust. Either you are or are not faithful to your SO, or it doesn't matter. Sort that out. You cannot do trips with other people if the SO is going to be jealous. My hubby and I have both had that trust in the other, that we drew boundaries the other could rely on.Point two, you have needs. Communicate this clearly to the SO, but also line it out just what that means. Perhaps one weekend a month you are on a trip, two nights per week you are climbing locally, two mornings a week at the gym....whatever.

He went to Joshua Tree with me a few times, but became angry and hated it.  So, that's a problem.Now I am traveling alone, and climbing completely alone, and he grimaces when the subject of climbing comes up--so I never mention it.  Our relationship is all but over, we just haven't made it official yet.   It's not fair to expect him to love this stuff when he really prefers to be sedentary and is a homebody, but it's also not fair to ask me to stay home on weekends and watch TV.So, bottom line... you have to evaluate how much the relationship means to you, and whether you still have enough in common that you can both make some compromises.  Yes, to rgold!Edit: one other thought: knowing that I will probably be without a boyfriend soon, I have wondered what the future may hold. Honestly, I'm not sure how I'd be with someone who was completely obsessed with climbing!  I would probably fall way behind, not be able to keep up... and I also want balance in my life.  Movies, books, politics... date nights, and weekends now and then just vegging... what it this new rock climbing guru just wanted to climb, climb, climb?  So... .it might be hard to find an exact match.  Maybe love and caring for the other person comes first... climbing a distant second.  ",11,"Joshua Tree, CA",Apr 2017,Points: 235,4.491071428571429

Communicate this clearly to the SO, but also line it out just what that means. Perhaps one weekend a month you are on a trip, two nights per week you are climbing locally, two mornings a week at the gym....whatever. If he knows he is on his own every Thursday evening, for instance, he can also plan ahead for his time. I am actively doing this with my spouse now, and he is adjusting. It truly is important to me, to us actually, because if I don't keep at it both my mental and physical health will go straight down the tubes.Short answer: you have to talk it out. If the SO is unwilling, rethink it.Best, OLHI would add point three. In order for the relationship to survive long-term, you need to have something you really enjoy doing together, to make the time you spend together as interesting as the time you spend pursuing your passion for climbing. If your only fun thing in life is climbing, and the only things you do with your SO are the boring drudgery things of everyday life, pretty soon you start associating boredom and drudgery with your SO, and at that point things between you are over.My husband is into computer gaming. I'm not. So he makes the time when I am gone his really intensive gaming time.We are both into board games, but there are certain types of games (D&D-type, UGH!!!!!!) that I cannot stand. So he schedules Gloomhaven for the weekend when I'm gone, and we plan board games that we both enjoy for the nights when we are both available.Finally, we are both into dancing. He is a much better swing dancer than I am, and he is the reason I got back into swing dancing after a long multi-year hiatus. I got him into Argentine tango. Dancing community is almost as fun as the climbing community, as hard as it might be for MP people to imagine, LOL.",21,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.3375

120583833,"Jan 11, 2022",Eric Roe,"Unfortunately, I think if you limit yourself to soliciting feedback from women with T1D you may limit your audience to just a few people.  Including men I think you'll get a reasonable discussion going. So apologies in advance for inserting myself.First, here's another thread with some discussion: https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/118034585/type-1-diabetes-and-climbingI contributed to that thread, but over the intervening years I've changed a bit and of course gotten more experience, including climbing at altitude and more involved multi day back country trips (climbing and otherwise).To answer your original post:1. The only place I wear my CGM is on the back of my arm.  Rarely gets in the way of climbing (chimneys and offwidths being the normal exceptions).  Everywhere else gets in the way or takes more abuse and falls off early.  I got some medical tape patches which fit around the G6 (they'll provide them for free if you call, or you can get them on Amazon) but they're decidedly unsexy which is a deal breaker for me.  If I know I'll be in the woods for more than ~36 hours I'll bring a traditional testing kit as a backup.2. BG management is complicated and entirely depends on what your goals are.  If you could provide some example objectives or workouts I could give more specific recommendations.  As a rule of thumb, limiting on board insulin is key when doing any sort of exercise.  I personally haven't noticed any problems with dehydration.  Ideally you would be drinking plenty of water + electrolytes.  I've under-budgeted on water a few times and it sucks, but I can't say it sucks more for me as a T1 than it does for my partners.  3. I'm definitely NOT an expert at muscle building lol.  The little bit I know basically says that diet is very important, especially for diabetics -- insulin promotes storing fat over building muscle mass (injected insulin in particular seems to have a bigger effect), so I've seen recommendations for low carb diets from other diabetics.",0,Spokane,Jan 2016,Points: 11,5.02710843373494

I usually do not bring my insulin pens out with me ice climbing since I’m so unlikely to have a high blood sugar or eat much and need to bolus. One concern is if I have to leave my insulin in the car while climbing. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence. I usually wrap the pen up in a fleece hoping it won’t freeze. Hasn’t happened yet  I suppose I could add a hand warmer near by to keep it in a normal temp.My CGM transmits right to my iPhone so as long as I start the day with a full battery, I’m golden. ",0,Philadelphia PA,Nov 2012,Points: 0,4.066945606694561

121445302,"Oct 20, 2021",Claire Bootsma,"My understanding of the Mirena is that 6 months after placement you should resume ovulating as normal. It’s totally a personal decision but you’re happy with the birth control provided by Mirena I’d go with basal temp or try a cycle tracking app to determine your cycle rather than removing. I personally love the freedom of not getting a period on the Mirena, it means I never have to pack in or pack out sanitary products from the backcountry. Also while some cycles are consistent it’s also totally normal to have varied cycles. Mine can have up to a 10 day difference. If you had consistent cycles before the Mirena you’ll probably be able to nail down your cycle after a couple cycles with basal temp + a tracking app. If you didn’t have consistent cycles pre IUD though you likely still don’t, which could make trying to coordinate training with your cycle tricky. Good luck! Hope you find a solution that works well for you!",1,Portland,Sep 2019,Points: 0,4.614457831325301

But, unless your training is already tuned super-precisely, and use have squeezed every possible gain out of it, and are looking for incrementally-smaller gains... IMO you could focus your efforts elsewhere, and get better gains from training. ",4,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.880434782608695

I was lucky I had it removed, as it had been growing into my cervix (rare situation). But I’d also been wanting it out for other reasons. I felt like having been on hormonal birth control since 16, I wanted to know what my cycle was like without extra hormones. Interestingly after about 2 weeks I immediately felt relief from a low level anxiety I’ve suffered from all my life. I had always chocked it up to my C-PTSD but now I know that it was caused by hormonal birth control. With climbing, the benefits have been that I’m able to back off in the days leading up to my period when I’m most prone to soft tissue injury. Also I have felt increasingly more able to give myself space to weather the emotional impacts of PMS when it comes to climbing performance. ",5,"Tucson, AZ",Nov 2013,Points: 41,4.39873417721519

Unfortunately, this won't help rape victims generally but it may help victims get justice by finding others who are willing to prosecute the same offender (thereby strengthening their case).I believe this woman's story and I don't think her account needs to be called into question in order to respect the right of due process for the accused.

I started climbing on our home rock wall around 6-8 weeks, but not aggressively. More so just to see if i could do it. Around 10 weeks I started bouldering. I haven’t returned to trad or sport climbing yet due to needing a third person and our climbing spot is about 2.5 hrs away one way…so we are still working on that one.I had a third degree tear following delivery and ended up doing nothing but sitting for the first three weeks due to our daughter staying in the NICU. Around 5-6 weeks I started doing beach body with focus on leg and upper body strengthening. I also did planks but avoided crunches.Around 8 weeks I returned to running (started with 1-2 miles here and there). Remember your Abs have been stretched and will take some time to recover. Be aware of diastasis recti. I remember trying my first pull up and barely being able to do one at 6 weeks!The big thing is listen to your body. If you feel pressure and discomfort then don’t push it. Your body did a big thing so you don’t want to overdo it. At 6 weeks I also had my follow up with my doctor. He checked my pelvic floor but I had to request for an internal exam. If you are uncertain on healing then I would definitely have them check it out because they can look at the pelvic floor that way.Also if you have any leaking or anything then a pelvic floor therapist can be great! They can be good even if you don’t have leaking but have questions! Don’t forget your kegels!Hoping the healing goes well! Biggest advice is listen to your body.

121471498,"Oct 16, 2021",Jenna Frickinfrack,"Hey Soofar,It's been a while since I squirt a pup out, but I remember being very antsy to get climbing again. I climbed up until a week before birth (pretty sure that's what signaled to the little dude to exit). I began climbing postpartum three weeks at a local crag (once) and then again a couple of weeks later and while it felt wonderful mentally/emotionally, my body was nowhere near ready. That said, my first climb back was Infinite Bliss (10D 22 pitches) and so my choice of routes was admittedly ridiculous. I took a few weeks break again and eased back into climbing at the gym once a week for a bit, but again, my body said ""nope"" and so eventually I listened. Unfortunately, because of my poor choices, it prolonged my healing and took me longer to get back to a more consistent climbing routine. The impact meant more bleeding, my abs didn't join back up in the middle and general prolonged discomfort. Your body just went through something major and now it needs to heal and then rebuild. I did all of the wrong things because climbing/skiing/movement brings me joy and more importantly, keeps my mind at ease and typically, when I'm told I can't do something, I make sure to do it. Eventually when I accepted my limits and reframed my thinking, I found patience and compassion for my body. At that point, I started doing the following: walking hills (with baby in stroller) and low intensity body-weight exercises - special focus on strengthening lower back and legs. When something felt off, I stopped. When my body gave me signs (blood, cramping, etc.), I stopped. Had I started off with that mentality rather than a stupid long climb and a marathon a few weeks later, I would have healed 100X faster. Within nine months to a year, I was fully healed and capable of regularly climbing, however, my body was a new body and one that I didn't know very well. Strength came a bit later and so did endurance. I understand everyone's experience is different and listening to your body is vital - it's doing such hard work healing and that takes time. I found that I am a better climber now than I was prior to giving birth. I climb harder and more often now than before and while my body is a lot different than its pre-baby version, it's a hell of a lot more resilient and capable. Way to go on squeezing a human out! ",3,Unknown Hometown,Aug 2019,Points: 80,4.508274231678487

You should at least give yourself 40 days postpartum before doing basically anything besides walking. If you try to hard to quickly you can make the ab separation worse. I would look up diastisis recti work outs and start doing those. Its crucial to not let your lower back hollow out when doing them and keep your core engaged.

119990443,"Nov 28, 2020",Zoe Stone,"So, I’ve had a pretty rough pregnancy in terms of being woefully underprepared for the effect all the hormones would have on me, but here’s my experience:I climbed as normally as I could between bouts of crippling nausea and exhaustion during the first trimester. I wasn’t too worried about falling. I was more worried about the waves of dizziness that sometimes happened and the occasional dry-heaving. These more than concern about the fall factor kept me mostly off the sharp end.Toward the end of the first trimester it started feeling... different ... with my harness so I switched to the Mad Rock Mountain Mama I bought. It took a while to figure out how to adjust it properly (P.M. me for advice if you decide to use this model). I am just under 5’2“ and would not recommend this harness if you are any shorter - I was barely able to get it to fit me with most of the straps all the way tightened. I like that it is pregnancy-specific and has leg padding but it only has one gear loop which is a huge bummer. This harness comes with a little paper saying that it is only meant for top-roping so I emailed Mad Rock to ask about what might happen if, hypothetically, one were to take a fall while leading in it or catch a fall while lead belaying. The answer I got was that they “could not recommend anything but top rope climbing”. I took this to mean that the testing required to find out what effects of falling would be on a pregnant woman and her baby would be unethical and they didn’t want to get sued but that I should probably do what I wanted. In the spirit of calculated risks, I climbed almost exclusively with my husband and I didn’t lead while wearing that harness. He did, and I belayed him but we stuck to routes that were well within our ability and tried to avoid anything with major runouts.  I say tried, but it’s mostly amazing multi-pitch granite around here and that usually includes an easy but terrifying slab section. So we tried to be responsible but we were also lucky. On falling particularly: I did end up catching two minor lead falls during the early second trimester without a problem. I’m talking about very small, at or just above gear. Both times, he knew he was going to fall and was able to warn me and do it gently. Catching them didn’t feel any different than taking a top rope fall when you have a very dynamic rope that‘s not birthday-belay tight. However, it’s really important to have the harness adjusted properly so it doesn’t clutch your ribs and snap your butt back on the catch, very uncomfortable. Since the straps tend to loosen on their own, this means you need to be constantly checking and adjusting. The only time we thought there was potential for a real lead fall, we built a second, lower anchor and specifically directed it for upward pull. I belayed off of that instead of my harness. This turned out to be a smart move because he did take the fall, and it was a big one. Since the anchor wasn’t taut and I hadn’t lead belayed from an anchor before, I didn’t manage to pull slack in as quickly as usual so he took a longer fall than he would have if we’d been climbing normally. Even if he’d been belayed from my harness it would have been a big fall, but this fall resulted in an injury that shortened our climbing season. I don’t know if that injury could have been prevented with better rope management on my part. We both agreed that the anchor catch and ankle injury was much better than a potential baby injury would have been, but it felt shitty that he fell that far. My advice from this is to get familiar with belaying from an anchor. Build one at home and practice taking in slack quickly without fumbling the rope, or learning how to keep tension on the anchor so it’s less awkward to pull the slack in. Also, assess the climb and your ability. We both felt that the correct decision was made in this case. Things could have turned out better but they also could have been a lot worse. Around 28 weeks, I really started to feel like my balance was affected. More than that, I felt a sense of vulnerability that I haven’t experienced before. I found myself becoming a lot more intimidated by even minor swing potential or ledges while following and I was a lot less comfortable with having a little slack in the line. I just wasn’t climbing at my normal ability and I found that not knowing exactly what my ability was could be extremely unnerving. It didn’t help that it varied drastically from day to day. It was around this time that the weather was turning anyway so I never had to turn down a potential outdoor climbing day because of this. We simply chose easier routes or areas that had a good variety. Now I’m 34 weeks and the exhaustion has returned.

I wasn’t too worried about falling. I was more worried about the waves of dizziness that sometimes happened and the occasional dry-heaving. These more than concern about the fall factor kept me mostly off the sharp end.Toward the end of the first trimester it started feeling... different ... with my harness so I switched to the Mad Rock Mountain Mama I bought. It took a while to figure out how to adjust it properly (P.M. me for advice if you decide to use this model). I am just under 5’2“ and would not recommend this harness if you are any shorter - I was barely able to get it to fit me with most of the straps all the way tightened. I like that it is pregnancy-specific and has leg padding but it only has one gear loop which is a huge bummer. This harness comes with a little paper saying that it is only meant for top-roping so I emailed Mad Rock to ask about what might happen if, hypothetically, one were to take a fall while leading in it or catch a fall while lead belaying. The answer I got was that they “could not recommend anything but top rope climbing”. I took this to mean that the testing required to find out what effects of falling would be on a pregnant woman and her baby would be unethical and they didn’t want to get sued but that I should probably do what I wanted. In the spirit of calculated risks, I climbed almost exclusively with my husband and I didn’t lead while wearing that harness. He did, and I belayed him but we stuck to routes that were well within our ability and tried to avoid anything with major runouts.  I say tried, but it’s mostly amazing multi-pitch granite around here and that usually includes an easy but terrifying slab section. So we tried to be responsible but we were also lucky. On falling particularly: I did end up catching two minor lead falls during the early second trimester without a problem. I’m talking about very small, at or just above gear. Both times, he knew he was going to fall and was able to warn me and do it gently. Catching them didn’t feel any different than taking a top rope fall when you have a very dynamic rope that‘s not birthday-belay tight. However, it’s really important to have the harness adjusted properly so it doesn’t clutch your ribs and snap your butt back on the catch, very uncomfortable. Since the straps tend to loosen on their own, this means you need to be constantly checking and adjusting. The only time we thought there was potential for a real lead fall, we built a second, lower anchor and specifically directed it for upward pull. I belayed off of that instead of my harness. This turned out to be a smart move because he did take the fall, and it was a big one. Since the anchor wasn’t taut and I hadn’t lead belayed from an anchor before, I didn’t manage to pull slack in as quickly as usual so he took a longer fall than he would have if we’d been climbing normally. Even if he’d been belayed from my harness it would have been a big fall, but this fall resulted in an injury that shortened our climbing season. I don’t know if that injury could have been prevented with better rope management on my part. We both agreed that the anchor catch and ankle injury was much better than a potential baby injury would have been, but it felt shitty that he fell that far. My advice from this is to get familiar with belaying from an anchor. Build one at home and practice taking in slack quickly without fumbling the rope, or learning how to keep tension on the anchor so it’s less awkward to pull the slack in. Also, assess the climb and your ability. We both felt that the correct decision was made in this case. Things could have turned out better but they also could have been a lot worse. Around 28 weeks, I really started to feel like my balance was affected. More than that, I felt a sense of vulnerability that I haven’t experienced before. I found myself becoming a lot more intimidated by even minor swing potential or ledges while following and I was a lot less comfortable with having a little slack in the line. I just wasn’t climbing at my normal ability and I found that not knowing exactly what my ability was could be extremely unnerving. It didn’t help that it varied drastically from day to day. It was around this time that the weather was turning anyway so I never had to turn down a potential outdoor climbing day because of this. We simply chose easier routes or areas that had a good variety. Now I’m 34 weeks and the exhaustion has returned.

I have been debating about getting it. To the OP:I am currently 16 wks and climbing without issue. I feel a little weaker in the UE but that might be from a couple weeks off from climbing. I have been climbing through the whole pregnancy without difficulty. Still in my original harness. This is my first tho and i am not really showing. I have not done any lead climbing more so because i wasn’t very confident with lead climbing to begin with (only did 5.7 and never tried harder due to fear). I am still top roping at my normal skill level around 5.10 and still lead belaying without difficulty. The first trimester was hard more due to nausea and fatigue. This trimester has been better. Like everyone has said above, keep in mind everyone is different so listen to your body and be open with your doctor! I am not sure how long i will climb for. My guess is i might need to consider a new harness at 18-20 wks. I am still debating whether to go the full body harness route or not. I climb mainly with my husband so we will have to consider lead belaying as well. Hope that helps and congrats!",2,Unknown Hometown,Oct 2019,Points: 0,4.346347607052897

Nothing hard. I lead one pitch while Pregnant but it was 5.5/5.6 during 2nd trimester. We only had a gym first trimester as we were in Japan so no leading. We didn't climb harder than 5.9 through 2nd trimester and 5.7 early into 3rd trimester then the grades got less and less finishing with 5.6 routes in Yosemite the last few weeks of pregnancy. I ice climbed at the end of first trimester and could still use my regular harness but switched to a full body as it was more comfortable. We climbed a lot of multi pitch in 2nd trimester, cracks were VERY difficult but tried some anyways. We chose to not let me lead at this point and keep the grades easier to avoid falls and keep it fun. The goal wasnt to push myself rather enjoy what I love and stay active/strong. In doing so we were well within my husbands comfort level for climbing so he never fell while I was belaying. The full body harness I had didn't sit on my belly wierd so if I had fallen or he had fallen I wouldn't have been worried about it hurting me or baby. I had to navigate peeing on routes a lot more than usual like every belay. Carried more water than usual and also snacks but it was manageable. I wore a small camel pack backpack for all my things and just managed myself between pitches. As I got further along I'd get more tired so 2-3pitches at most was plenty. Listen to your body is the best advice.

I'd say the biggest thing I've learned is that you're not going to really be able to control how much your body will let you climb while pregnant and that's ok. As someone who usually finds physical endeavors not that difficult I definitely felt totally blindsided by how hard pregnancy has been. I'm 29 weeks and have had daily nausea and 2-4 vomiting episodes a week for the entirety of my pregnancy (though near the end of the first trimester there were a few weeks of daily puking). The nausea set in around 5 weeks, at which point I was still lead climbing in the gym and outside in my regular harness. From 7-16 weeks I was too nauseas to do more than daily walks. I didn't boulder at all while pregnant as I prefer rope climbing and was also feeling too crappy to climb for most of the first trimester. I had decided when I found out I was pregnant that I would stop leading and bouldering after the first trimester because that's around the time when baby grows big enough to no longer be protected by your pelvic bowl. I was also shocked by how fatigued I was during the first trimester, daily naps and a 7pm bedtime if I could swing it, SO tired. I started back with a few gym and outdoor session from weeks 16-25 wearing a full body pregnancy harness. I only top-roped and would only top rope belay my partners. I was still having a lot of nausea which was exacerbated by wearing a mask for gym climbing. I found I could top-rope near my lead grade on vertical climbs but anything overhung felt really uncomfortable for my core so I avoided that type of climbing. From 26 weeks on I decided to stop climbing as I wasn't finding it fun, both because of my nausea and because everything in my body was feeling more uncomfortable. Other activities I have tried during pregnancy include running and swimming. Running is my other pre-pregnancy go to activity and I did it for a few weeks in my second trimester but then I switched back to walks because my joints hurt from the extra weight. Swimming has been my favorite pregnancy activity, the way the water supports your increased body weight has helped my body feel the closest to normal that I've been able to achieve during pregnancy. Good luck to everyone out there going through this same journey. It's going to be a different experience for each of us and whatever makes you feel good, or even just ok is what you should be doing. I definitely feel like I have just been surviving and not thriving. It's nice to know there's an end date with a hopefully happy outcome at the end of all this. I feel like pregnancy will seem like a blip when I look back on it, but it can be really hard when you're in the midst of it.",2,Portland,Sep 2019,Points: 0,4.384615384615385

I am seeking female climbing mentors and training partners in the Portland area.I had the sad realization that in the last six years of rock climbing, I have never had a partner say “that route looks hard, I know you can do it” and encourage me to hop on something that challenges me to push my grade. Instead, I’ve had ex boyfriends and climbing club instructors tell me to only “climb routes you won’t fall on” and actively discourage me from trying to lead above 5.8. There are SO MANY issues I have with that sentiment and frankly I am tired of 5.9. Locally, those are often blocky and lack clean falls. In fact, I recently sprained my ankle on one and that experience was the wake up call I’ve been needing that it’s time for me to move beyond 5.9.I am tired of being told there’s a limit to my climbing potential and I want to find out what my body and mind are capable of instead.Next season, I would like to climb Acid Baby, The Valkyrie, and Clean Break; while being fit enough to second 11+. I would also like to make it out to Red Rocks and Indian creek. In particular, I would like to climb Epinephrine as that was a route I was told would “always be too hard” for me and “never possible”.Those are my short term goals. Eventually, I would like to be in shape to lead some of the long classics in Rocky Mountain National Park and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. And do routes like the North Face of Mt Stuart and Solid Gold locally.I have taken courses in WFR, trad climbing, crevasse rescue, rock climbing self rescue and climbed in seven states/three countries. Without any real training, I was leading 11cs at planet granite and finally got my first 5.10 trad lead this summer at City of Rocks. I am hoping to be in shape for Smith in a couple months but will have to see how my ankle does before figuring out short term expectations. Right now I have to be a top rope hero so it’s the perfect time for me to belay you for your project and train along with you! Always happy to carry the rope and bring crag snacks.

He was arrested over the weekend after my neighbor caught him in my backyard at 9:30 p.m. This person climbs almost exclusively with women.

Especially with a pack that carries a heavy load, one that is designed to ride on your body requires hip belts that are canted properly and straps that are the appropriate size, shape and width. Although I'm not specifically looking for an alpinists' pack, there will likely be times were I will be roped up and climbing with it on. For this reason, most backpacking packs do not work since the waist belt is generally way too wide and the hip pockets are too cumbersome. I especially find that women, who's harnesses sit higher than men's, trying to wear a pack with the waist belt on completely blocks all your gear loops, making it even more baffling why there is no women's specific climbig pack, with gear loops on the waist belt. I'm super sick of doing long days in the mountains with inferior and inadequate gear.

I understood there were no women-specific ones out there and gave up looking for one from the very beginning. I identified Patagonia Cragsmith 45L as a bag I wanted to look into but I really wanted to see it in person and try it on before committing to pay $200 plus tax. So I went into my local Patagonia store (I had never been to any Patagonia store before) and tried it on. I loved it. Store only had it in black but they ordered it on dolomite blue color for me and I got it shipped to my house within 5 days. I've used it several times since then and love it. It's very comfortable to carry around, opens in the back, and fits everything you need to take with you to the crag for one-pitch routes. Note that I'm 5'10"" tall but the bag comes in two sizes and also has adjustable straps so it helps a lot with sizing.Now I'm looking into a multi-pitch bag and again, there are no women-specific ones.

And two of my friends (one male, one female) are totally rocking the Hyperlite.I think I'm still having a hard time understanding what the OP wants.I may be wrong, but I'm thinking of backpacking/carrying packs as the packs with internal frame, suspension, comfy padded belts, etc. Not the lightest packs, but optimized to carry long distance well. These often have lots of straps, loops, etc for attaching things externally, stowing a water bottle in side pockets, etc.And when I'm thinking of climbing packs I'm thinking smaller size, no internal frame, so they would mold to your back more, and allow more freedom of movement in climbing, but they aren't super-comfortable to carry heavy weight in. And also not too many straps/things hanging on the outside, so they can be hauled in a pinch, either as-is, or with a hauling cover that some packs have. A lot of climbing packs don't even have a waist belt. Or if they do, it is light/flimsy, often unpadded, or attached with a velcro, or something like that.And then there is a haul bag, where the emphasis is on durability and lack of things that snag on rocks, also not the most comfortable ones to carry while hiking long distance, and generally aren't meant to be worn while doing technical climbing at all, just meant to be hauled, while climbing.I know people who do technical climbing in alpine environment who sometimes would carry two packs. A big ""expedition"" pack for carrying stuff up the mountain, basically hiking uphill. And a smaller pack that they strap on top of the big pack when they are carrying to base camp. And then for climbing they would put on the small pack.But it seems that OP wants all of the above in one pack, I don't know if such thing exists in men's or women's pack at all... and  then it has to be labeled ""women specific"" and ""climbing"".OP, you mentioned that you covet/admire some of your male partner's packs. Can you name specific models, so it would be easier to see what you are looking for?",2,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.744578313253012

I fully suspect once this one wears out I’ll be buying another one. It’s awesome. I’m primarily a trad climber, prefer long multi- and alpine climbing. I have also used this harness for sport, ice climbing, etc. Misty Mountain harnesses are made in the US, they will customize harnesses and also offer standard models. The Cadillac is far and away the most commonly recommended harness in a couple of large women’s forums I contribute to. It has adjustable leg loops, six gear loops, ice tool clipper loops, wide waist and leg loops for comfy sitting, and is super light and durable. Also should note I am in no way affiliated with Misty. Just love their stuff. Worth every penny. Hope that helps!",7,"San Francisco, CA",Apr 2017,Points: 16,4.767441860465116

I was assaulted by someone who was my climbing partner and friend and ended up with a head injury that took months to recover from. I've handled the legal issues, but I've only told a couple of people in my friend group the identity of the person responsible. The guy still goes to the same gyms and climbing areas as I do and interacts with people in my climbing circle. It doesn't seem that he fully recognizes why what he did was wrong or how much worse the consequences could have been. I've had one previous experience like this years ago with a climbing acquaintance who tried to sexually assault me during a group climbing trip. I found out from other female acquaintances afterwards that he had a well-known habit of doing that when he was drunk. I did file a police report, and he never approached me again, but I don't know if he learned from it. I wish I had known about his history before I went on the trip with him.If this was you and your community, would you want to be aware if someone had engaged in such egregious behavior? How would you go about letting people know? In previous instances where I've had bad interactions with people, I've generally just avoided them and assumed their bad behavior would speak for itself. I don't know if that's the appropriate thing to do in situations where the person could continue to pose a significant risk to others if they are unaware of his/her past actions. ",45,Unknown Hometown,Mar 2021,Points: 0,4.524822695035461
120428420,"Mar 23, 2021",carla rosa,"First, just want to say that I'm so sorry you had to experience that and I feel for you. I had a similar experience years ago, where, someone that climbed at the gym I frequented assaulted me and refused to truly acknowledge how wrong that was. I tried to tell people about his behavior but it became apparent to me after the fact that he was known for being an aggressive person (also while drinking) and had a habit of breaking things and getting violent with other people. It became totally weird for me to go to the gym and he would still try to be cool with me and I had to shut it down each and every time. I found out he had assaulted another woman at the same gym before me (I talked with her directly about it), and I even found that people were hearing about what happened between us but never came to ask me directly. It just seemed that people knew about his behavior but didn't know how to handle being around an abuser and chose to never bring it up (or did? I don't know) and would keep him in their circles. A few people believed me and didn't interact with him, but generally, I still saw him amongst the same group of people and he would go to events/parties/hang outs where I'd then opt out to avoid being around him. I'm not really sure what to tell you... For me, I would definitely want to know. We can't really change how people choose to interact with others. I think in my situation at least, they just didn't know how to confront the abuser about his behavior, especially because it didn't happen to them directly. I was willing to tell anybody that asked me what had happened. However, when I was proactive about it, I didn't receive the response I had thought I would. I say, tell anyone/everyone, especially if you see the abusive person interacting with someone you think could be at risk. The only thing you can do is be honest about your experience, share it, and hope for the best for the person you're warning, but in the end you can only truly protect yourself. Edited to add: if you ever want an additional person to talk to, I'm available for you.

The guy still goes to the same gyms and climbing areas as I do and interacts with people in my climbing circle. It doesn't seem that he fully recognizes why what he did was wrong or how much worse the consequences could have been. I've had one previous experience like this years ago with a climbing acquaintance who tried to sexually assault me during a group climbing trip. I found out from other female acquaintances afterwards that he had a well-known habit of doing that when he was drunk. I did file a police report, and he never approached me again, but I don't know if he learned from it. I wish I had known about his history before I went on the trip with him.If this was you and your community, would you want to be aware if someone had engaged in such egregious behavior? How would you go about letting people know? In previous instances where I've had bad interactions with people, I've generally just avoided them and assumed their bad behavior would speak for itself. I don't know if that's the appropriate thing to do in situations where the person could continue to pose a significant risk to others if they are unaware of his/her past actions. I'm very sorry this happened to you. It is of course absolutely unacceptable and intolerable in any community. I think the trust and mutual responsibility that is necessary in any healthy relationship is brought to the fore in climbing in particular, which makes it all the more infuriating. I always want to be aware of how people in my circles are behaving towards others, because oftentimes it can be hidden from view. I think one-on-one conversations are a good starting place, i.e. with mutual friends who might be brave enough to confront the miscreant and tactful enough to do it in a productive way. (Making people want to do better rather than just become defensive) I also think it is appropriate to let others who may be at risk aware, but ultimately if the bad behaving person doesn't see that they're hurting others, or worse don't see that it's wrong to hurt others then the problem will always be there.",8,Unknown Hometown,Aug 2015,Points: 1,4.597752808988764
120428420,"Mar 24, 2021",Kate Michelle,"I think a lot about this too, and don't have the answers but do think there is some reckoning that needs to happen in the community. On a personal level, I absolutely would want to know about toxic or violent behavior, and would hope that people would warn me and others about what they had experienced. That being said, I know that can be a difficult thing for those who were at the receiving end of abuse to have to revisit it in order to spread the word. On a bigger community level, there are more than a few stories of well-known violent or abusive people who continue to move in climbing circles without much of a reckoning aside from an occasional post somewhere that gets buried over time. For example, there is a pretty well-known guy who has been up and down the eastern sierras and inter-mountain west for years who has run the gamut from basic creepiness all the way through abusive, violent outbursts, sexual predation, and stalking/following. Yet there seems to have been no concrete consequences... a police report here or there, warnings posted from time to time on private women's forums, but nothing else. And in a very real way, I don't know what that something else would be. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I don't have a great answer to your second question: How would you go about letting people know? In person I am more than happy to share my stories and experiences, but beyond that, I'm not sure. Conversation seems best but that doesn't get us beyond immediate circles, especially when so many of us as climbers can travel pretty extensively. Thanks for bringing up this topic. ",14,"San Francisco, CA",Apr 2017,Points: 16,4.607638888888889

Many psychopaths are charming. (Important to note that the negative is not valid - most charming people are not pyschopaths).So these people often fly under the radar - unchecked and ready to do whatever abusive thing to the next person.

Having a van is seen as somewhat of a privilege, regardless of how “hard” you work. The good news is that you can typically scrape together a budget option that works - you can live in a car or cheaper no-standing van, for example.The boomer generation passes on its riches in such a way where trust fund/inheritance = “good for them” but general social welfare/free healthcare/education = “freeloader”. It gets very confusing and non-sensical very fast. Such is America. This fact becomes extremely awkward and not exactly something people are dying to talk about - especially as the racial lines of who exactly is allowed to enjoy the privilege of the bougie side of van-life are clearly drawn... The only way that changes is via systemic changes that can only happen politically (i.e if you’re a resident of the U.S you are entitled to tuition free public university, you are entitled to free healthcare, you are entitled to a living wage, etc) - that way we can chip away at that gap - and who knows, we might see more hard working people from the Latino, Black, as well as immigrant communities also camping in nice sprinter vans instead of it being mostly white people from the ‘burbs with the odd Asian person thrown into the mix. Anyway, I’ll try not to contribute too much to thread drift in this thread - I agree with your other points. ",3,"Portland, OR",Mar 2014,Points: 658,4.4245283018867925

POC take out more student debt, have significantly less generational wealth, and overall less access to the luxuries of American life - sprinter vans are firmly included in that category. Basically, this was a response to the idea that everybody in a nice van “worked hard” for it - as if that’s the chief reason why it’s mostly white people from the suburbs who inhabit the sprinters.

I gave him several chances, but in the end, he couldn't help becoming a womanizing pos (which maybe he always had been), who incessantly talked about women, in the worst of ways, and treated people with no respect, especially females. Long story short, he went on a rant about how he was going to fck our mutual friend's wife, and I felt compelled to share this information with my friend so that he was aware of who this guy really was. In the end, the friend handled his business and shut that shit down, BUT sadly he also doesn't talk to me anymore, which I had considered before taking action. So... the moral of the story is, do the right thing, no matter what. You sharing info about this pos could save someone down the road a lot of pain, but don't expect anything for it, and be prepared to turn away the people you're trying to help. In the end, exposing horrible people is worth it. The only thing I'd add is, Im a guy, and feel confident I can defend myself, but if you dont feel the same way, maybe the safest thing for you is to get this info out vicariously through other people so nothing blows back on you.

120428420,"Mar 25, 2021",Kate Michelle,"To bring this back to the original topic: 1. This is not uncommon in climbing 2. It can be surprisingly hard to be believed when the perpetrator is a well-known member of the local climbing community. As with any community, it tends to circle the wagons and excuse bad behavior from insiders. Consider who has clout and who doesn't in climbing circles. 3. If you are able, please do warn others, however there are people who do not feel able to because of #2. 4. Much as I would love to just put on blast every example of abusive, gross, or toxic behavior in a public forum like MP and include names and locations to warn everyone about it, consider how #2 can cause even more challenges in an online space. 5. Gyms should take seriously police reports and restraining orders. Most gyms do. Some gyms don't. Again, #2 comes into play. If the perpetrator has been climbing at that gym for years and is buddies with the owner, etc. etc. it can be pretty damn hard to see any real action or consequences. However this doesn't do anything for outdoor climbing. 6. Much as I love how interested folks are in discussing relative privilege, stand-up vans, and trust funds, consider how this could be derailing and diluting the conversation OP originally was trying to have. Abuse, assault, toxic behavior, and violence happen in this community. What can we each in our respective positions do about it?

I'm super happy with my progress, but I feel like my fitness routine has become pretty saturated by climbing.I've been told not to climb every day, so I don't. But I'm not really sure how to integrate other exercise into my weekly routine, especially since outdoor climbing is so weather-dependent.Before I climbed, I was pretty big on running, and did a bit of lifting as well, and it seems like those things should be good complements for climbing. But I'm no fitness pro, and I'm not really sure how frequently I should loop those things in, or with what intensity.I'd love to hear how other people balance climbing with any kind of cross training (if you do yoga or ballet or jiu jitsu or whatever, I'd love to hear about that too).Basically, my goal here is to create a summer workout schedule so that I can shake off the winter weight and maintain fitness over the next year.Thanks for your insight!",0,"Hopewell, NJ",Jun 2020,Points: 0,4.603351955307263

The synthetic bag and the bivvy sack take the brunt of the condensation from my breathing so the down bag stays dry. Yep it’s heavy and takes up a lot of space but worth it for a cozy night of sleep. This is using a tarp rather than a tent, hence the bivvy. So if your current bag doesn’t work out that’s another idea. Also versatile for different temps. More universal info below:I have found that the main factor in staying warm is using the baffle on the inner bag and also stuffing a down jacket around my head and neck so the warm air is totally trapped inside. Also insulation from the ground is key. I usually double up on ground layers. ",1,"Narvik, NO",Sep 2016,Points: 0,4.296511627906977

117406984,"Jul 25, 2019",Aerili,"First things first: why is it so hard to find an ideal-even-pretty-ok climbing pack?? I feel women-specific packs are highly pigeon-holed in their features, none of which are really what I'm looking to be rolled in one package, but then again, I haven't carried allll the packs. ""Unisex"" packs leave a lot to be desired as well.Ladies, have you ever used Mystery Ranch packs and liked them for carrying climbing gear? I realize they make a couple climbing specific packs, although I am not really looking at those models right now, unless I hear some rave reviews. Their climbing packs are designed as top loaders, and I'm interested in switching to a pack that opens at least partially down the front. So I was perusing their Y-zip products in the 40-50 L range.It ain't easy where I currently live to go try on a fuck ton of brands and models unless I pay a gazillion dollars in shipping and so forth, but even when I did live in such a place, I found that store fittings (even with weight added to simulate loads) and actual real life carrying experience didn't pan out to be equivalent anyway.I've used Osprey - always was comfy for me but maybe a bit high on the bells and whistles side (maybe I'm just bitching and it was fine- this was a long time ago too, stuff changes). But, top loader (-1)I've used a ""unisex"" Black Diamond Speed.... Carried it for years; I've finally cleaned and retired it cause I just hate the damn thing. Sooo uncomfortable. The top loading opening constantly drove me nuts getting things in/out. Loved how lightweight it was, though. (-5 + 1)I've carried some REI ""unisex"" packs.... never again. I'm currently using a Gregory Jade (38 L?) that is not intended to be my long term climbing pack.... I just found it on a deep discount and thought I'd see if it worked as a pack I could use sometime for....something. So it's my interim gear carriage til I can figure out something better. It does have both top loading and straight-in side access options, but it also hurt my back quite a bit for some reason during a loooong hike up and out of the mountains not long ago. The space configuration isn't exactly what I would prefer, either, but it's ok. (it's a draw?)I've looked at partners' ""unisex"" Patagonia packs (the ones that zip all the way open). I have heard mixed feedback on those. I have looked at the Marmot packs that zip all the way open too. I have one partner who had one and he said he would never get one again.... something about the quality, I dunno.I'm usually around a medium size in women's packs.... What dost say you? Any suggestions or experiences to relate? Again, would prefer a non-""only top loading"" model if possible. I always love a good deal, but I'd be willing to throw down a fair amount of dollars for something that is really comfortable with the right features.

I think it was actually dangerous a few times futzing around trying to bounce my rope in or out of the bag on small ledges. What are you looking to carry?I just got a Black Diamond Creek 50 this summer. It's a bucket-style top-loader that also fully unzips down one side for gear access. I like that it will stand up or lie down for easy loading and unloading and the fabric is super durable. It's not designed to carry up multi-pitch, but it works great as a leave-at-the-base or sport crag pack. You can throw a rope, double rack, shoes, etc. in the main compartment. There's another full-length front compartment with a zipper pocket inside for carrying water, food, guidebook, keys and ID, sunscreen, etc. Comes with an integrated rain hood you can pull over the drawstring fabric at the top. At first I was concerned that the shoulder straps would be boob-squishers, but I find it rides comfortably when loaded. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a compartment for a hydration bladder, but that can be worked around.For carrying on multi-pitch, I have an 18L Petzl Bug which I love with the fire of a thousand suns. It's the most comfortable pack I have ever worn - fits like a dream, and the shoulder straps are some high tech squishy stuff that are light years better than most pack fabrics. It's designed to ride higher and sit above your harness for easy gear access, which would be good if your torso is short. It has more than enough room for 4 or 5 liters of water, food, med kit, guidebook, rain layer, etc. Has a centered daisy chain for attaching things to the outside in a load-balanced way. It also has a top strap and side straps you can use to cinch a rope over the top of the pack for approaches and descents. So much better than tying the rope to yourself! It's small enough to fit in the front compartment of the Creek 50 if you want to have the big pack for the approach and the small pack for the route. The only things that are less than perfect about the Bug are 1) the super comfy back panel is not very breathable, so it gets sweaty. Like, really, really sweaty. 2) There is an internal sleeve for a hydration bladder, but it only goes halfway up and there's no hook or loop to attach the bladder to keep it from folding over. I fixed this by rigging a small loop of accessory cord to the haul loop and poking the cord loop back inside the pack through the slot for the hydration hose.  I can hook my bladder to this loop.",8,"Boulder, CO",Apr 2014,Points: 105,4.325051759834369

But it was always a bit of a puzzle game. If I wanted a thermos, then water bottle went outside. If I had a down jacket AND fleece pants, something had to be strapped outside.  The rope had to be packed just so, not too wide, not to long, etc.With my pack now I really love that I have that extra room. If it's hot, and I want three water bottles -- no problem. If I want to take off both my down jacket, and the fleece for the hike, I can stuff them in with minimal fuss.

Is stable enough to stand up on its own.  You can set this thing upright, open the top loader, and just dump your gear into it. And suprisingly is quite light for the fact that it can do this.  2. It has back panel access that allows you to fully unzip the back panel and load all your gear sort of like a suitcase. Really nice if you have the triple rack and need to tame the octopus of cams going into the pack.3. Beyond comfortable for the carry.  The hip belts are nice and cushioned without being overbuilt and the back panel of the pack is super protective.4. The top pocket is extremely roomy and gives you all the space in the world for snacks, your phone, a smaller interior pocket for your keys etc.5. A mesh pocket on the side for a nalgene - clutch.6. The smaller size is great for smaller people(i.e women) - i accidentally got the small time for the first go round and it was too small, but i left my friend try it on and she said it was a perfect fit - she is usually a medium womens.7.  Comes in a 45L and a 32L - the link above is the 45.  its a generous 45 without being huge.  but it can fit everything, including a double rack, shoes, harness, chalk bag, and even rope, if you shove.  The rope can also be carried draped over the top, and their are side compression straps with hooks to tension down the loose ends of the coilHope this helps, happy hunting.",4,Salt Lake City,May 2011,Points: 195,4.806666666666667

I thought this training plan was pretty good. http://www.fitclimb.com/page/mount-rainier-training-plan To the extent you can go up 14ers and do lots of hiking in advance, I think that's the best training.Other than typical gear lists, here's what I would recommend:Whittaker Mountaineering shop is close to Rainier and you can rent a ton of stuff - mountaineering boots, ice axe, crampons, gaiters, big jacket. Anything that you think you don't need to buy if you don't do too much mountaineering.Clothes are pretty typical ""alpine"" wear - Softshell pant depending on temperature - I have Mountain Hardware chockstone pant with some built in gaitery thing which I use for ice climbing which I think is ideal. When I went it was actually super warm so I wore a lighter softshell pantHardshell pant - the guides tell you to bring a hardshell pant, you can rent thisShirt / undergarment layer - pretty self explanatory, there are a bunch of brands. A lot of people like to get one with a hood to protect your neck from the sunMid layer - there are a lot of brands, I've had an Arcteryx atom jacket which I've had forever, but if I were buying now I would get the Proton FL, looks really niceOuter layer / down - most people have an outer hardshell in the case of rain + ginormous down for when they are resting. I am a very cold person and I already had a fairly waterproof softshell that has thin down in it, which is what I wore most of the time, plus Rab Neutrino for wearing when we took a breakSleeping stuff - depending on what you already have and what you do outside of mountaineering. I have a 0 degree down sleeping bag and one of the new Thermarest ultralights which I think are totally worth it. Maybe you can rent this too. Or try to buy around the holidays when there are couponsGloves - I have Rab women's Baltoro glove which I really likeThis is not comprehensive, there are a ton of detailed trip reports you can look at where people talk about what they brought. All of this stuff you can check out REI outlet, I personally like Mountain Hardwear, Outdoor Research, and Rab as reasonably priced brands. Sometimes Mountain Hardwear and Rab have nice sales on their sites, and I think Arcteryx does now too if you want something fancy.Have fun, train, and let me know if you have other questions!",3,"S Lake Tahoe, CA",Sep 2019,Points: 0,4.5717647058823525

I've found that one of the best ways to get better is to climb with people who are climbing just a little harder than you. You can ask questions like, ""how did you do this move?"" and learn so much. It is hard when people have already paired up with either their SOs or other partners, but keep trying.

The last paragraph is key, I think, for mismatched abilities. That's the boat I will be in forever, honestly, so my level of ""try hard"" has to be kept very, very high. Which is fine by me! A partner who can enjoy my super modest ""triumphs"", and grasp that I have some physical challenges, is a big plus. Not everyone is that sort of partner, though, which is fine, but not for long, for me at least.That said, I have hugely enjoyed the opportunities to offer a belay to out of town climbers on those one time only partnerships, and I've casually swapped belays with tons of folks at gyms.

I didn't climb when my kids were babies, because I wasn’t hooked on climbing back then. I had climbed a little bit before I got pregnant, and then took a couple-year break. But it is not fundamentally different than returning to any kind of weight-bearing exercise that uses abdominal muscles. I was teaching a “body sculpting” free-weights exercise class while pregnant, and had to substitute-teach a class a week post-partum, with no ill effects (obviously, I reduced the weights during pregnancy, and stopped doing crunches, etc, as I got bigger. Then re-started slowly.But many of my friends had climbed through pregnancy and very soon post-partum.In one case, my friend felt great, started climbing couple weeks after giving birth, over-did it, started bleeding heavily and having cramps. Nothing dangerous in the long term, but still, she took the next 4 weeks off. With her second child, she waited until 6 weeks postpartum, and thought the recovery to her before-the-baby fitness went just as fast, if not faster, than with her first attempt to try pushing things ASAP. In the grand scheme of things, couple weeks is nothing. ",2,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",5.0390243902439025

If you are one of the lucky women who had no problems with latching, and got the breastfeeding figured out easily, if your baby is gaining weight, and things are going smoothly, there is nothing different about going out to the crag vs going out for a stroll in the park, or a trip to the mall with the baby. You just stop whatever you are doing, and nurse her. If you and your partner can’t stop what you are doing at the moments notice, and take care of your baby’s needs, while climbing, you probably shouldn’t be doing it with the baby.Bouldering, single-pitchh climbing, gym sessions— those can always be paused as soon as the baby needs you. ",1,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.526717557251908

I remember getting them, but it may not be universal. I wouldn’t mess around with diastasis recti, if you actually have a large separation. A fingertips width doesn’t sound big, if you had just given birth, that sounds like normal that heals without intervention, but if you haven’t had a go-ahead from the dr, or given specific exercises you should/shouldn’t do, don’t wing it. See a PT. You only need a visit or two to make sure you are doing the right exercises, and in good form.It’s been a long time, but I remember that the postpartum exercises specifically work on strengthening transverse abdominal muscle, and  a big no-no are things like crunches and sit-ups, as well as no extreme back bends. Basically, you don’t want exercises that cause your abdominal muscles to bulge outward, don’t want things that increase the intra-abdominal pressure (I.e. no holding your breath while you are doing the exercises), you don’t want to make your ribs flare out forward/outward, and you don’t want the movement to come from arching the back. Pretty much anything you do starts with engaging the pelvic muscles and drawing your belly button in and up towards your spine, as you perform the exercises. I remember one-legged heel taps, alternating leg raises, with the other leg bent/planted on the floor, wall sits...  ",2,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.930656934306569

I'm looking at the Surly ECR in particular and am wary because the standover height (726 mm) is about an inch higher than my inseam (27.5''), and the reach/effective top tube length seems a bit long as well.My road bike has a similar standover (722 mm) and it hasn't been a problem for me yet, but I'm also looking at taking the Surly on much rougher terrain, so it seems a bit more important here. I'm also just worried, based on the geometry specs, that the Surly will feel slightly too big overall.Right now I'm choosing between the Surly ECR and Salsa Fargo, and could get the ECR frame for about $500 cheaper, so I'd love for it to work...but I also don't want to buy something that doesn't really fit.

The strap that took the weight was around my high-waist-lower-ribcage area. Does anyone else have experience with this? I know these harnesses are not intended for taking lead falls and it’s possible (probable) that my leading days are over until I’m flying solo in my body again. I do plan on following some sweet long alpine multi-pitch routes now that I’m in the second trimester and have some energy back.

If I lead anything it was a pitch that was no harder than 5.6 and I haven't done that since end of May so just before 3rd trimester. Just didn't feel it was safe. Basically I climbed things I 100% knew I wouldn't fall on unless it was top rope. I did multi pitch routes no more than 6 pitches up until about 30 weeks and then at most I do 2 right now even though I feel like I can do more I know my bodies releasing more relaxin hormone and I hear pops which makes me think it's just not wise to keep doing to much. The nerve pain has gotten tremendously worse so I'm not sure what more I'll do in the next couple weeks before her arrival maybe some 5.5-5.6. I use the petzl 8003 full body harness and haven't had any issues but again we decided the name of the game was to not fall and not push the grades. 2nd trimester hardest I tried was a 5.9 finger crack.

119232678,"Jul 30, 2020",Fern Braun,"I climbed normally through my first trimester and then quit leading and switched to a larger sized regular harness when I started showing a bit around the start of the second trimester. I started wearing the Mountain Mama harness around the third trimester and also stopped lead belaying (other than easy stuff with a trusted partner) at that time. I didn't experiment with catching big lead falls in the pregnancy harness but it seemed like it could result in getting pulled face forward into the rock instead of feet first like a normal harness. I wouldn't recommend doing anything in the Mountain Mama other than a snug toprope personally -- I found just lowering in it to be pretty uncomfortable. Cinching the leg loops super tight seemed to help take some pressure off the chest, but all of the buckles would loosen while I was climbing anyway. The lack of gear loops is also super annoying.I found climbing while heavily pregnant to be very style-specific. I took a trip to Ten Sleep while 8 months pregnant and had a lot of fun on vertical stuff -- I went from being a 5.12 climber to a 5.11 climber, so not a huge difference all things considered. The car ride there was way more uncomfortable than the climbing!  Overhangs get really hard though...pregnancy has given me a whole new level of respect for the importance of core strength in climbing.

116217879,"Jan 21, 2019",Lena chita,"Hope you have gotten out a few more times since December. It is definitely not easy.Bouldering is the easiest to do with the young baby, because you can jump off at any moment to take care of the baby;s needs. And bouldering is social, so groups of people are common, and it is not too much of an imposition to ask someone to watch your baby when the baby is happily kicking up his feet and sucking his fist, because the person would know that you'll come running as soon as the crying starts.Multipitch is out for the foreseeable future, unless you can hire a nanny. Single-pitch climbing is doable, but requires more logistics/preparation than bouldering. You would need two people (ideally you and your partner/co-parent) who are willing to take care of the baby for larger chunks of time, realistically 30-45 min, including doing less-pleasant duties, such as handling/minimizing the crying, feeding, diaper changes, etc., and the 3rd person who is either willing to do the same, or is willing to do extra shifts of belay duty. So there would be a lot fewer willing takers, and that's why parents often seek other parents for climbing. The drawback, of course, is that you end up with a larger (and louder) group that includes multiple kids and quickly becomes the crag nuisance with toys, playpens, and kiddie tents strewn all over the place. Be extra-mindful of that, and If you have any friends who are willing to be the 3rd for roped climbing with babies, treat them extra-!!!-well.You do have an option of bringing a teenage helper along. It is often much cheaper and less scary to do this, than to find a nanny for a young baby, and leave the baby at home with the nanny for the whole weekend. If you have an option of climbing near your house, and coming back home for the night to sleep in your own bed, it is a million times easier. If you have to factor in a long car ride and camping with the baby, and your climbing outing has to be at least a weekend long, by necessity, the logistics multiply quickly. But it is not impossible. You just need to plan well, and know that the more you do it, the easier it becomes.And the part about things getting easier the more you do it is true, regardless of what it is you decide to do with the baby. Going climbing once, you may luck out and hit a bad weekend, and think, oh no, I can't handle this, this is horrible, I can't handle the screaming, the colic,or whatever, I got no sleep, I I didn't get to climb anything, it sucked, no way, not worth it. But if you are committed to going regularly, things will start falling into place. The baby will get used to long car rides, and sleeping in a tent, and napping at the crag, you will have your packing down to precise science, you ill figure out the best snacks, and the best toys, and everyone will become more relaxed as things become more routine.",5,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.458015267175573

What my friends did when their son was a similar age was go to a crag and get him settle/asleep in a safe area a ways out from the wall. One would belay the other up, they would set up a fixed line on the highest anchor of the wall and rap down. Knowing the route they were leading that was a very limited amount of time for their son to be unattended. Then they would take turns TR soloing routes while the other stayed with their son. Granted this was on weekdays when the crag is empty, so probably not the most helpful advice if you're on a 9-5 schedule. ",1,"Kent, WA",Jan 2015,Points: 651,4.022388059701493

Interested in a broader perspective.I volunteer instruct women every winter in a beginner's ice climbing program. Women usually make up a quarter to a third of students (and one year they were the majority). About half our male students go on to lead ice, but in five years, I've only seen a small handful of women dabble on the sharp end and usually well below their limit. The interest is there, the instruction is equal, so why the ice attrition? Some theories: need for more foundational strength, disenchantment with the sport's machismo, lack of female partners and role models, lack of mentorship opportunities, others?FWIW, I'm a little more interested in women's perspectives and open to advice for how to make women's ice instruction better.",13,"Boulder, CO",Oct 2012,Points: 60,4.946308724832215

114161135,"Mar 14, 2018",Alissa Doherty,"That may be true but I think it may be an oversimplification. Risk aversion exists on a scale and I don't think ice climbing representation is an accurate reflection of that scale across genders.When I began ice climbing, I thought the risk of leading was beyond a level I was comfortable with. In reality, I simply wasn't getting good enough sticks. I got stronger and with the security that comes with bomber placements, ice climbing became a new sport to me and the perception of risk was greatly diminished. I think that there are perhaps women's physiological differences that play a big part in the gender disparity. Perhaps existing instruction doesn't address this well enough. How can we do it better ladies?",3,"Boulder, CO",Oct 2012,Points: 60,4.885245901639344
114161135,"Mar 14, 2018",Alyssa K,"Interesting question! For context, I'm a woman who's been learning to ice climb the last two seasons. I've TR'd about 100 pitches and plan to ease into leading before the end of the season. I agree with Blake that a big part of it is risk aversion/tolerance. I think in the climbing community on average, men tend to have a much higher risk tolerance. I like feeling in control when I'm climbing, probably moreso than many male climbers. With a lot of factors that can feel out of my control, it's taken me awhile to get used to ice climbing.I tend to focus more on objective hazards than my male partners. Especially while alpine or ice climbing. I want to identify and mitigate risks as much as I can since I recognize that ice/alpine climbing already has enough inherent risk even if you do everything right. So something that's helped me become more confident on ice is having a super solid understanding of all the foreseeable hazards and feeling confident in my ability to assess and mitigate where possible. In terms of your teaching, maybe this means having a bigger focus on what can go wrong, and how to reduce the likelihood of those things happening. And presenting a framework for thinking through all these considerations (having a structured way to consider risk has been HUGE in enabling me to push my comfort zone in all climbing disciplines). One more thing is just confidence. I think a lot of women are less confident in their physical climbing abilities than men. You cannot fall when leading ice. So I've been holding off on leading til I feel 100%...that threshold may be lower for the average guy. As for your other theories, they definitely make sense but they're not huge for me. It would be nice to have women partners or role models, but I don't feel like it's what's holding me back. It might be nice to have more female mentorship in the community though, to have a broader perspective on how other women have approached risk in leading ice. ",10,South Lake Tahoe,Mar 2014,Points: 46,4.650429799426934

114161135,"Mar 14, 2018",Aerili,"Here's my story: I've been wanting to start leading ice for about 3 years now. But, you know, it takes a while to get comfortable and strong on vertical waterfall ice. Leading is not as blase as when leading with clippy doo's or springy things....as we know. In my first couple years, by the time I felt warmed up doing topropes first, I'd feel too fatigued to be confident on the sharp end. Then there's practicing screw placement as well. It's not often something you concentrate on right away when you're learning, and learning ice can take a while. It's not the technique being hard so much as making all solid moves and managing the pump.  Other factors for me have been:When first starting out, trying to get both competent and properly geared up ($$$) while finishing grad school was an obstacle (who knew the two situations are not highly compatible).Using my partners' tools for a few seasons which were often large and heavy for my hands. This meant I fatigued faster and had worse swings quicker as the day went on. I finally got some Cobras and they are much more suited for my hand size and strength. I get consistently better sticks now, obviously a vital component of leading safely. The limited days per year of actually getting on ice compared to rock, i.e. in most places, you get so many less days to ""practice"" on ice! Factor in getting a partner + the ice quality being decent + safe conditions + plus finding routes others aren't on -- it makes for less climbing per year. (On the flip side, you really get a bang for your buck once you do get on, especially if the ice is fresh.)The realities of climate change. I have been unable to climb virtually whole winters a couple years due to lack of normal ice flows forming up. I really need more mileage to begin leading confidently, and winters don't always care.The realities of physiology. As a woman who is not built like a gymnast, I don't have tons of upper body strength reserve and you've gotta feel you have the strength endurance to make the moves, place the screws, etc. You can't feel any doubt about what you've got left in your tank, so if you have a smaller tank to begin with, you have to carefully consider what you can and can't do safely.  Some health issues I've experienced in the last couple years have not helped make me an ice climbing machine with lots of energy to travel more and climb. In my case, risk aversion has nothing to do with it. I don't have more risk aversion than men-- and definitely less than many I've climbed with. So I won't pretend to speak for other women on that topic as I'm usually baffled why a woman would be more risk averse - since my mind doesn't operate that way.Not sure if female role models would make a difference for me or not. I endorse them and feel good about women doing that, but I am also used to and can excel in a male majority climbing environment. Not sure that would be the same right now if I hadn't already been rock climbing for over a decade, though.  ",5,"Los Alamos, NM",Mar 2007,"Points: 1,875",4.443636363636363

114161135,"Mar 27, 2018",Deirdre,"There are a couple of things that I think are at play. I'm not sure that the argument that women are more fearful than men holds up. I can be as brave or as stupid (whichever way you want to put it) as a man. Women generally have less free time because of the second shift - all of the domestic labor that men often don't think they have to do. That means there is less time to bundle everyone up and out to ice climb. Women are more likely to get stuck with the kids. My kid will amuse herself at the crag in the summer so I can lead single pitches but I don't think she'd be psyched to do this while freezing her ass off in the winter. This means not having enough time on ice to feel anywhere near comfortable leading. Ice is also damn hard. It is like a living thing and to me it feels like it can change from one minute to the next.

114161135,"Mar 29, 2018",Dara,"Alissa, I can't answer for other women, but I'll say that risk-aversion is certainly one of the reasons  I don't lead more, or harder, ice.What else could it be?I love the cold, I have the resources and time to travel to great ice venues, I have had an abundance of female instructors, guides, mentors and climbing partners, I have the gear, my upper body strength is pretty good for someone my age, and I LOOOOOVE ice climbing. But I only lead WI 3, and I don't think that's going to change at this point. But I started in my 50s, and the older I get the less I want to risk doing major damage to my body because it's just too traumatic and it takes too long to come back. (See also: Rock climbing. I don't practice falls because I don't want to fall because....well, you get the picture.)But who's to say those other factors aren't in play for your female students? All that ""other stuff""--cold tolerance, female role models and mentors, strength, gear, and the ability to get to the ice--didn't come immediately for me. It took time (for me, 3-4 years) to put all that together. Maybe your female students are not sufficiently smitten with the sport to follow through? In my experience, I was never challenged or pressured to take the sharp end--perhaps your female students have the same experience? I would be interested to know whether men who are learning to ice climb get that kind of challenge from others? Or does it come from within? I hate to generalize, but it might be easier for women to find others to lead, and they may not feel that they are ""expected"" to lead. They might not be aware that leading is a key skill and a natural part of their progression in the sport. Somebody's gotta put that rope up there, right? Somebody's gotta show the young ones how it's done, right? Are you, in your instruction, laying out the opportunities and responsibilities that come with leading? Do you present leading as an eventuality and an expectation, rather than a possibility? If not, maybe that would plant a seed. If you're already emphasizing it, hmmmmm......¯\_(ツ)_/¯   It's a good question. We have some awesome lady crushers in the sport, wouldn't it be nice to see your students evolve that way?

A romantic relationship can make criticizing your partner's mistakes particularly difficult.  Taking a picture of a particularly bad piece of gear or leaving it in place and rapping the pitch together to look at it can help.  Be prepared to lead the route if the new leader does not think she is up for it.  Be prepared to retreat.  Here is one of my favorite pictures.  The mentee was scared and place a perfect cam behind an obviously loose block.   Interestingly, the mentee skipped a perfect placement 5 feet above this.  It took only a second of looking at the picture for her to understand the mistake and she never made that mistake again.   This placement is also a danger to the belayer, if the leader had fallen at any point above this piece, even with a good piece above it, the rock would almost certainly have been dislodged and fallen on the belay.There is lots to learn, much more than placing gear on lead especially if you are planning on trad climbing off the beaten path.Learning to read a route is very important.  There are no bolts showing the way.How do you communicate in windy conditions and stay safe.  I recommend the windy day rule where the rope is always on belay.  Leader builds the anchor, puts the follower on belay and pulls the rope up through the belay device.  That why the bottom belayer knows that he is on belay when the rope comes tight or else you are simul climbing.There is building of anchors which can involve lots of different techniques and difficulties.  How to manage the rack so you have gear to build a belay.   What do you do if you don't have the gear.  Can you belay off a tree or a boulder.  Do you belay off the anchor or off the harness?How do get off the mountain.  Especially if the descent is not clear.None of this is really any different if the mentee is male or female.Teaching a new leader is a great way to expand your knowledge.   Be patient and let the new leader set the pace of the education.EDIT:Praise especially good placements and belays.Set attainable goals and celebrate your successes.  Teach alternate ways to do the same thing.

117023164,"May 27, 2019",Em Cos,"I think trad leading especially has to be strongly intrinsically motivated. If someone decides it's not for them, there's not much you can do to change that which will turn out well.I started out climbing trad, so the only transition I had was from following to leading. I was super psyched to lead but worried my partners would be bummed to share leading and would rather be leading all the time, and/or be annoyed to follow super easy grades as I was learning. Reassurance that they were equally psyched to follow and really looking forward to sharing leading equally and not having to lead every pitch helped a lot. That might be very specific to me?More generally, I think it's always important when in the mentee stage of anything, to have many or at least several different mentors to learn from. You get a wider range of advice, techniques, and feedback and a better opportunity to evaluate what you're learning and critically think about what works best for you, along with an appreciation for there being more than one ""right"" way to do things, rather than learning only one way from one person, which is limiting and sometimes leads to new leaders clinging dogmatically to one way of doing things.All this goes double, I think, when there is a significant prior relationship between partners. Whether romantic significant other, siblings, parent/child, or best friends since childhood - there's just extra ""stuff"" tied up in that relationship that can get in the way of growing in a new skillset. You can support your partner climbing with other people, and maybe make some introductions of safe partners you would vouch for if you're better connected in your local climbing community than she. I think there's also a lot of value in two newish (but compentent in the basics) trad leaders teaming up. There's a lot of growth that for some can only happen when there isn't a far more experienced partner to hand the rope to when things get hard or scary.Awesome that you're looking for ways to best support your partner!

117023164,"May 27, 2019",ErikaNW,"Agree with Em! I also started with trad - but it was a long time before I started leading. I had cleaned a lot of gear by that time. One of the barriers for me was feeling slow and being worried about holding things up - especially when it felt like I was taking forever to go off belay and build anchors. Having a partner (who is also my significant other) be patient with climbing easier grades and not rushing was key. It was (and is) really satisfying for me to swing leads on long easy climbs. If he wants to climb harder some days I will follow and enjoy that too - but he always offers to have me lead (never assumes I don’t want to). We will also pick our pitches and sometimes lead in blocks if there are stacked pitches that I don’t feel comfortable leading instead of swinging leads. He would also basically aid the pitch when following to test my gear and give me feedback when I was first starting. I don’t think breaking into trad is gender specific but do recognize there is an additional relationship dynamic at play with the OP’s question.

117023164,"May 27, 2019",Jeffrey K,"1st) There is no difference between a man or woman learning Trad in terms of skill/confidence/etc.. The only difference is some people's preconceived notion that women are worse and/or less interested in Trad, which is ridiculous and can create a needless barrier of entry for women. This post should be in the Trad forum.With that said, there seem to be two separate things you're looking for advice on. One is how to nurture interest in Trad and the other is how to deal with a climbing partner that is also your romantic partner. Very different issues but fair to ask for help with.I can't speak to the latter but as a new Trad leader I can to the former.The three most important things IMO are: choose very safe routes with obvious pro, never push the follower out of their comfort zone , and make sure your own practices as a leader are textbook safe. Nothing will scare a follower more than losing trust in the leader; if you're climbing in an ultra safe way it will inspire confidence.Finding easy but super fun multi pitch routes is a great way to show how cool Trad can be. Don't be in a rush to improve your followers skill, look for routes that are safe, fun and give that ""wow"" moment when you reach the top.",2,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2018,Points: 0,4.475336322869955

Be supportive and encouraging. Climb a lot of easy terrain, but choose routes/areas that are fun, and preferably something that you would think is fun for you, too, rather than than something that you are willing to slog through, for her sake. If you can go to new areas where you haven’t been before, where everything is new and exciting for you, too, that’s great. Avoid any indication of impatience with her, the long time it takes to sew up an easy climb, or boredom with the chosen routes/grades. I’m sure she would easily pick up on the vibe, being your life partner, as well as the climbing partner. If you are genuinely excited for her, and happy about your day, you hardly need to do anything else, if she is as self-motivated in this pursuit as you say she is. If you have other friends who enjoy trad climbing, and if there are opportunities for you to go with couple other people, and switch up partners for a day, so she climbs with other people, too, it would be helpful to her to climb with others. But ultimately, really, just be a good partner that you presumably are, and that’s it.I’m one of those people who toyed with trad, but I don’t consider myself a trad climber, even though I have led respectable grades on gear, back when I was climbing trad more regularly m, and have taken falls on gear. For me it was all about the partners. When I climbed with people who were experienced gear climbers, and we went to areas that were predominantly trad, I plugged gear. It was cool enough, but when these people moved away, I stopped climbing trad. Now I occasionally climb an easy route or two, when I get to climb with these people again, but that’s about it. I really enjoy the process of redpointing hard sport climbs, I love the movement style of overhanging sport climbing, my home area has a lifetime supply of sport climbing, and I have a much higher threshold of confidence for a trad climbing partner, because I myself am not that experienced, so I want someone much more experienced than me. So realistically, the only way I would pick up trad climbing again, for myself, is if I were to move someplace where gear climbing was the only good climbing to be had. I don’t think of trad climbing as the end goal in itself, the end goal for me has always been the climbing. If this is fun climbing, and the only way I can do it would be to place gear, I would be placing gear. Otherwise—nah. ",8,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.446315789473684

Does that differ significantly from what you're expecting/looking for in sport climbing partners?Franck, I can totally relate to your excitement about the joys of trad climbing, and your excitement about having your main climbing partner wanting to potentially do a lot more of this type of climbing with you!  I love trad climbing.  It's a little funny (and shocking!) to hear you say you don't see that many women leading trad climbs, because when I started climbing, there were few other options - sport climbing was in its infancy.What motivated me to become a lead (trad) climber was that my husband, who introduced me to climbing, transitioned to another sport and basically quit climbing about a year after I started climbing.  I couldn't imagine anyone wanting me as a partner unless I could be a real partner, that is, to switch leads as much as possible.  My passion for wanting to climb led to getting out and doing it and pushing myself.  So with your partner, if she has the passion to lead trad, it will happen.  Your goals about ""making sure"" and ""not wanting"" are not in your control.I agree with the sentiment that there is not gender-specificity in having the desire to lead trad.  What any more experienced leader/partner can do is:  provide good opportunities for the less experienced partner to practice; be patient;  don't push leads that the person says they are not ready for; provide non-judgmental feedback about the quality of gear placements.  The stronger and more technically proficient I became as a crack climber, the more confident I became as a leader - and that was also facilitated by following a lot of routes that were harder than I would have been comfortable leading, and cleaning a lot of gear placements.

I look forward to reading these reports because I learned so much from them, and I hope not to make the same and similar mistakes. There are many little mistakes that are within my control, but there are other mistakes that will be out of my control, and that is a scary thought, especially when it involves another person.A couple years ago, I took a group of climbers up to the north shore, a popular climbing destination in Minnesota. We were climbing at a place called Palisade Head, a cliff on Lake Superior. A few climbers were waiting to climb a route called Rapprochement, 10b, it was right in the amphitheater, behind a three feet tall retaining wall. After another group of climbers finished climbing and cleaned out their anchor,  they were not with us, so we didn't each other, I talked to the person cleaning the anchor and made sure that they were done and  he confirmed is, so I swooped in and got an anchor in and a climber on the rope, and lowed  my climber down the cliff. A few moments later, a young woman I did not know, walked behind me, crouched between me and the retaining wall, over my right, shoulder, and reached for my anchor and unscrewed my PAS from the anchor. She said, ""This is ours."" And for a second in my head, I was confused, because I knew that everything on that anchor was mine, and that biner she was unscrewing was my safety. She had taken me off the anchor. I must've said something like, ""This is my anchor. That's my safety."" The shock and confusion in my tone must've shocked her too, because she froze while pulling on my PAS.  I pushed the pile of rope on my lap aside, followed the PAS from my harness to the biner that she was holding as if to prove to her that this PAS was really mine. We both put the biner back on the anchor, screwed it tight, and tested it.  ""I'm so sorry. I thought it was outs. It looks like ours,"" she said, and she back away,  and disappeared into the crowds of tourists. At that moment I didn't know what to say. I was shocked and confused. Then I felt a wave of anger hit me like the wind. I wanted to get off belay duty and go after her and confront her. I looked over my shoulder again, and she was gone. Another wave of anger hit me again. I started to shake. The space between the cliff and the retaining wall was about three feet, and it was slanted so it was an uncomfortable spot to sit anyway, but without a safety in, you could slip off easily. Luckily I had a shoulder sling as a second PAS to keep me closer to the anchor that was clipped to the shelf of the anchor. I was not endangered, but if I didn't have that second safety, it could've been a different story. In that afterward moment, the shock, the anger, the fear, it all hit me pretty hard. And I didn't need to feel that way because I was safe, I had a second safety in, but it was all natural biological reaction to feel that way in that situation.Over the years, this experience had the most impact on me as a climber even though I've had my share of other experiences that are sketchier. What I learned from this experience is that as a climber, one should never go to another climber's anchor and take things from it.  I think like a lot of other activities, some things are taught and some things you'll just have to learn it the hard way. I never got to talk to that young lady. I hope that she's learned some lessons on her own, and is a safety-conscious climber now.",7,"Minneapolis, MN",Nov 2013,Points: 75,4.258308157099698

114326884,"May 2, 2018",Morty Gwin,"Almost all my partners are heavier than me by the same ratio.  I catch them easily with a standard atc. I also sometimes use a grigri or cinch. There's some tricks to it.  First of all, pay attention. Never get caught off guard.  I don't usually anchor myself. I make sure the first two placed pieces will handle an upward pull, sometimes placing a piece just for an upward pull and attaching it to the next one up. I use the terrain available, such as for back stepping a bit. I stabilize myself with one foot on the wall for lowering, which works very well. If I have time to anticipate a fall I will be sure to have a good lock off with the brake hand well below sometimes ready to sit into it.  I am very comfortable leaving the ground in a catch if the terrain under the leader is vertical with no ledges. This is the preferred catch for ice as it's less of a jolt on the gear. If I'm off the ground sometimes I have to lower the leader first and then myself. Hanging belays require good attention to the anchor to manage a pull into it without a cluster. Sometimes I belay from the anchor when belaying from the top with a locking device. It is much harder to lower from the top a heavier partner. Better to use a 3:1.   The belay weight difference when you are being belayed by a heavier climber has no effect. The rope stretch is adequate.  I've taken a full on 50 ft swinging whipper on gear that pulled my big guy off the deck which can be explained in fall factor. I have practiced falls with a new heavier than me partner so they know what to expect. What is a problem is simul rapping which is always difficult even when you clip to each other. Another thing besides weight is height. My 6'3 guy has the longest reach in the world it seems and with a grigri I have to be fast to belay his lead so he doesn't get short roped.

This comes into play at three points in the system: 1. Build a ground anchor and use it appropriately. 2. Add extra friction to the belay device. For an ATC, this is as simple as adding an additional locker. 3. Wear gloves. Also, if you're not already in the ""helmet always"" camp, it's a good idea to wear one considering you're anchored and can't dodge easily and someone extra heavy may be plummeting toward you. If there are other people in the group closer to his weight, it's not a bad idea to ask them to belay him. Also to belay you. It is generally possible for a heavier belayer to give a lighter climber a soft catch. However, I'm assuming this co-worker is new to climbing based on the phrase ""asked me to take him climbing"", and you probably shouldn't expect a super nuanced belay and a soft catch from a complete beginner.

I use an Ohm, can't say enough good things about it, absolutely would not want to lead belay someone that heavy without an Ohm. Yes, anchoring also works, but is a hassle, and not always an option for sport climbing. I much prefer the flexibility of being able to move around on the ground, which you get with the Ohm. In the gym, there is often the rope wrapped around the pipe at the top, and that creates a lot of extra friction. As much as I hate that setup, I don't need to anchor myself when belaying the same guy in the gym on toprope, if the rope is wrapped around the pipe. Climbing outside, you can use the OHM even if you are belaying on toprope, and that avoids the need for anchoring. (you put the OHM on belayer's side of the rope, and still clip it to the first bolt, or the first bolt of a nearby route, if the crag is not busy, and there is another route close by). You would have to get really proficient at stick clipping and removing the draw with a stick-clip, because you would have to switch up the first draw with and without ohm, every time you climb with this guy, if you climb the same routes.I'd say do not rush taking this guy climbing outside. Go to the gym first, and see how well he crushes, before you take him outside. ",4,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.19921875

117390940,"Jul 22, 2019",Old lady H,"Lead belaying is simple to practice in a gym. All you need is a third person, and a wall with a top rope and a bolt line, that's easy climbing. The top rope is the real belay. Have a leader mock lead, until you are used to feeding slack and watching the rope, etc. For catching falls, you might be able to use the same setup, check with the gym. Or, ask gym staff to help you practice, after taking their class. They probably have staff that would coach you, if it comes to it. Mock leading yourself, helps with clipping and rope awareness for your lead. Use a regular rope, so you have that weight to haul! You might be able to mock lead on an autobelay.If it's allowed, someone who is willing can give some actual lead falls, with a backup belayer with hands on the rope. I did falls just a couple days ago, with a staff guy as the backup, so someone could start getting used to catching lead falls. He was originally falling himself, and I said something like, ""its way more important to catch ​falls than to take them"", offered to jump for them, and we were off.

If you're not already using an assisted braking device like a gri-gri, pilot, mega-jul, or smart, you may want to check those out. They all have pros and cons, but are designed to make it harder to drop your climber. The big thing with these devices is learning how to avoid short-roping since they don't always feed smoothly.Also, when you first start lead belaying, it may be helpful to climb with someone who will climb conservatively and isn't going to be taking big whips all the time. Ideally, you want to get in a lot of early mileage lead belaying where you are reasonably certain your partner is not going to fall unannounced. This will help you feel more comfortable with the mechanics of letting out slack and pulling it in, where to stand, how to use belay specs, etc.Once you have the easier stuff dialed, you can intentionally add the details related to catching falls: soft vs. hard catches, how to hold them stationary after a fall, helping your partner jug back up to where they fell, etc.A lot of it is going to be ""on the job"" learning, just as it was when you learned to top-rope belay.

Strength training with weights made a huge difference for me -  Low reps heavy weights, twice/week.  Hypermobility - this was and is still a huge challenge for me.

117521984,"Jul 30, 2019",Lena chita,"Couple other thoughts that occur to me:1) bouldering. A lot of women tend to shy away from it, but that is a great way to develop more power, and to work on harder moves more efficiently.2) I understand the desire to collect a lot of info, but there is also such thing as choice paralysis. Different plans recommend different things, and you end up searching for more and more info, that would somehow magically reconcile all the different plans, and not doing anything in the meantime. If you are new to training, it almost doesn't matter what you do, you will see improvement. Pick a plan from the list you already have. Do a random blindfolded poke-at-the-list, if you must. And commit to it for 12 weeks. The best plan won't do you a lick of good, if you don't do it.3) do as little TR as possible, especially outside. Lead every sport route you want to try. Don't TR a route before deciding that you would try leading it. Lead it. Hang all over the place. Stick clip through the crux, if you must. Heck, stick clip through half the route, if you must. leave a 'biner, if you must. That can also be training sometimes. Training to use a stick clip, lol. And also training to be more self-reliant.

Is the the ability to do pull-ups or not as a beginner/intermediate climber important? If you are a 5.11 climber and not able to do a pull-up, would it be good to work on this?  It is possible that bouldering etc, may develop pull up strength, but training pull-ups specifically might be quicker method. It would be interesting to hear other experiences.  I agree with Lena, there are so many options for training out there now. When I started I think the two options were Self Coached Climber and How to Climb 5.12 (E. Horst).Pick one and stick to it for 12 weeks, but after 3-4 weeks you should start seeing some small improvements.  ",2,Unknown Hometown,Jul 2008,"Points: 1,090",4.740458015267175
117521984,"Jul 30, 2019",Jay Samuelson,"How long have you been climbing?How many days a week do you climb? I would focus on all around training of your body to smooth out any imbalances/weaknesses you have and don't focus on climbing specific training unless you already climb 5.12 or harder and need specific gains like finger strength or max power. General fitness and balanced muscles are key to long term climbing without injury/pain in your joints and muscles and long term improvement.I found stabilizer muscle exercizes have been the most beneficial to me, things like band workouts for the shoulders, T's Y's and I's, leg extensions and raises for the hip flexors and glutes, focusing on posterior chain muscle groups and flexibility in the neck and back have helped the most along with pilates and yoga for core/balance. Climbing is about utilizing your body in the most efficient way possible, good posture and muscular balance throughout your body allow you to maximize the strength you already have as opposed to trying to overcompensate a given area in order to make up for a weaker one. i.e people often think they need to have more upper body strength to pull hard moves when often flexibility or core strength is what's actually limiting them. There is a point you just need to be stronger but unless your climbing 5.13 I wouldn't focus on that. Now if you can't do a pull up that's an obvious weakness you need to train. But don't get sucked into the 'I must be stronger to climb harder mentality', I watch people destroy their bodies at the gym all the time training and finger boarding when their technique sucks and they don't understand basic movement and mechanics. They run themselves into the ground and don't understand why they can't get better when they focus all their time on strength/power and almost none of it on technique or movement skills. When working out I focus on all around body stability, flexibility and balance between the anterior and posterior muscle groups with a goal of being well balanced throughout and having good posture/form. When training for climbing I focus on movement, technique, route reading, body position etc. Focus on the climbing part, not the strength part.

To SM Ryan's most recent point, although I'm a pretty active person and like to think I'm generally fairly strong, when I started climbing I couldn't do a pull-up at all. I am willing to bet many (though by no means all!) female/AFAB people start from a similar place. Since then I have climbed a fair amount, but put next to zero effort into training pull-ups. I still can't do a dead-hang pull-up with good form, although I discovered today that I can now do 3 if I kip a little (cheating!). On the one hand, I selfishly want to believe this argument that pull-ups are a waste of time. On the other hand, this argument that they can help train strength, pulling power, and the ability to lock off makes a certain amount of sense, too.Anyway, I'm going to try the beginner's training plan from Eric Hörst's Training for Climbing and see how it goes, plus focus more on training my weaknesses (big powerful movement, avoiding tunnel vision on hard-to-read sequences, maintaining mental focus when the climbing gets pumpy) when on the wall.

It is possible that someone is so weak that doing some pull-ups would be beneficial, but your pull-up ability sounds better-than-average for a female climbing 5.10. If you are following Horst’s plan, I think there are some pull-ups there, at least I remember scapular pull-ups from reading it a while back... but they are certainly not a centerpiece of the training plan. Which is a good thing long term for your elbows, lol. My experience has been the same as yours — my ability to do pull-ups has increased dramatically as I kept climbing and progressed, without ever working on pull-ups specifically.As a little personal anecdote, after I had a shoulder surgery 3 years ago, I went from being able to do I dunno... a dozen? 15-18? I didn’t check just before surgery, lol— to not being able to do a single one, only temporarily, obviously. I still couldn’t do one at the point in time when I was cleared by my surgeon to resume climbing. I couldn’t even deadhang on a bar with putting equal weight on both sides, I was a long way from being done with PT. I went to the gym, tried couple vertical lines on TR, and decided that a better test would be a slightly more overhanging route. I waited for a guy who was hanging his way up the easiest lead route, and then led it after he was done. Despite not being able to do pull-ups, the route felt easy enough.The guy watched me intently as I climbed the route, then, as I came down, he did a dozen perfect pull-ups on the starting jugs, and told his partner:” man, I really need to train pull-ups more! The overhangs really kill me!”It was one of those moments when you can’t say anything without sounding like a jerk, so I didn’t say anything. ",9,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",4.468277945619335

Did you find this to be true for you? Why or why not? I waited until 2 years of climbing 3-5 days a week and I was consistently climbing 5.11 in a gym when I began training. I wasn't climbing V5 then. Waiting was worth it because I had built some solid technique to maximize my limited strength. It was also so much fun to simply climb and those early years were a great foundation for a lifelong passion.What training plans/resources did you use? What did you find worked well, and what worked less well? Were there adaptations you made to them? The RCTM was great--I followed it very specifically and made incredible endurance gains. I burnt out on the demanding structure and subsequent training cycle were a mix of plans, without sacrificing time outdoors. Bouldering was extremely helpful across the board. Anecdotally, many women tend to experience mild-to-moderate hypermobility in various joints; if this is true for you, did you find particular types of strengthening/prehab exercises especially effective in avoiding injury due to hypermobility? I am hypermobile and haven't addressed it.Was there anything that you discovered through training that surprised you? Learning to rest in strenuous positions is key to improving performance. If you can execute the moves, you just need to learn where and when to rest in order to send.Any and all other thoughts appreciated! Most of my female climbing friends (and many climbing heroes) who have dedicated themselves fully to the sport for 3+ years have ended up with a shoulder injury. Anecdotally, it seems a much higher proportion than among my male friends. If I could go back, I would focus on strengthening exercises for the shoulder early on. I had surgery a few years ago and I feel great but I hate seeing so many female climbers go through the same thing. Also, since it isn't discussed often, bear in mind that your period will affect performance (especially training on the hangboard!). I try to keep tabs on PMS so I am not frustrated by increased weight, fatigue, or irritability. Ignoring PMS is a quick way to burn out on training and feel like gains are either impossible or erratic. ",11,"Boulder, CO",Oct 2012,Points: 60,4.9183168316831685

And  I think all climbers he tested could do some (5.12 and up).  But there was no correlation between number of pull-ups and grade climbed. Technique is really important but as more research is done, there are obviously strength factors to be successful, too. This is a balance and varies individually.  Some lucky folks just climb/boulder and get strong. The OP  asked for personal accounts and I reached a plateau where strength / power was a major weakness although I climbed a lot. Both times I focused on weighted pull-ups and other lifts.  And it only took about 3-4 months of focused effort to achieve a new level.In workouts, I do 1-5 reps in a set and do at most 10-12 reps total (with weights added).  So not many and it is not a centerpiece of my program. ",3,Unknown Hometown,Jul 2008,"Points: 1,090",4.495454545454545

116758638,"Apr 23, 2019",Natalie N,"Hey Kalli,I totally hear you on being nervous about traveling solo as a female on the road - I felt that way before my long road trips out West (California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming).Luckily I didn't have any car issues; I just brought the standard car kit: jumper cables, car fluids, tire change kit, tire pressure gauge. On my first long trip, I brought an inreach just in case my car broke down in the middle of nowhere where there wasn't any phone service. The inreach can also be nice to have if you're camping in a spot without cell service, which I found to often be the case for BLM land - but there are workarounds, like texting the GPS location for your camping spot prior to leaving cell service; I didn't bring the inreach on future trips. If you own a GPS, I personally liked using it more than my smartphone just because phone coverage can be unreliable along the road and one doesn't have to have offline maps for entire states.If concerned about safety, I would agree with FrankPS's suggestion of pepper spray; it's easy to get and cheap for a little added insurance. Personally, I didn't encounter any issues regarding safety, even when car camping in the middle of nowhere by myself in a new-to-me area. I used freecampsites.net to find places to sleep along the road, which is useful in both the U.S. and Canada - it has ratings, comments, and sometimes photos that you can review before choosing a spot.Traveling solo is a great experience and I felt so much more empowered following my solo 2000+ mi road trips.

When you park for the night, make sure that your car is in a position that is easy to get out in case you need to jump into the driver's seat and hightail out of there.  If you're going to be a few hours away from the nearest gas station, have an extra gas container in your car.  Have a couple gallons of water too. I think the most important thing is listen to your instincts. If you get to a spot and you feel weird or just off little, then go somewhere else. Pay attention to your senses.

116758638,"May 22, 2019",Katherine Delia,"Hey,I live in my truck for most of the year, both for extended climbing trips and for my regular life in AK. My favorite item for personal safety is not pepper spray but BEAR SPRAY, much stronger. I literally keep it next to my bed at night in case anyone tries to break into it- a very common problem up here, unfortunately. Its also helpful when I go climbing in bear country. :) I personally think that guns are too dangerous because of the possibility of them ending up in the hands of a criminal if they do break in and steal from your vehicle- but perhaps not a discussion for this forum.I agree with freecampsites.net recommendation and have used it all over the country for the past 8 years, though you should know that much of the traffic on there is RVers and they have a higher tolerance for weird places because they are a bit more sheltered than the average car/truck/van dweller. I keep a portable battery (to jump myself if I'm in a remote place) that has air compressor function on it as well. I generally keep extra oil and fluids around and a basic tool kit.

116758638,"May 22, 2019",Laser Sailor,"Bear spray is great, but ya gotta be careful if the safety clip is off the trigger... I once had a ""recreational accident"" while camping under 300-foot-tall Sitka Spruce trees in Bruceport, WA. Got so hammered by the campfire that I lurched toward a camp chair, the canister of bear spray stuck in a cup holder on the chair... hit the trigger and sprayed my leg, grabbed some paper towels to wipe the excess spray off my pants, tossed the towels into the fire, then made the GRIEVOUS ERROR of wiping my face with the same hand. Next thing I knew, my face felt like MOLTEN F#%NG LAVA, LOL... stood there yelling ""AAAAAAAAUUUGGGGHHH"" like Charlie Brown as the chemical burn put the hurt to my tissues, nobody else was around so I didn't hold back on the yelling. Man alive, that bear spray actually WORKS, and I heartily recommend it to women traveling solo. A good pistol provides extra security in remote locations, LOL.I'll add the advice I give to all my nieces and nephews, some of you may find it helpful: use large truck stops or travel plazas to refuel and knock out other tasks, they carry more parts and merchandise than the average gas station, most have restaurants, plus the bigger stops & plazas usually have better lighting and security guards, 10-4? Some rest areas are fine for car or truck camping, but the big truck stops and travel plazas are a nice, relatively safe option... don't believe the standard Holywad depiction of all truckers as evil criminals bent upon mass murder, filled with road rage and intent upon destroying the vehicles and lives of others traveling on the road. Fact is, most of those truckers have FAR MORE SAFETY TRAINING than the average Class C driver... sure, there are @$$holes out there, but the majority are just regular hands trying to make a living in the transportation industry.Here's a little more advice regarding road safety: don't hang out alongside or behind big trucks on the road, just pick your moment and smoothly accelerate past 'em, making your pass on a straightaway if possible, not on a curve or over a bridge. Reasons why ya don't wanna camp out near trucks on the highway: leaf springs can break and tumble back toward you, to literally crash through your windshield and spear you in your seat, while large truck tires can grenade next to you and send heavy fragments your way. Class C drivers have been KILLED in such incidents, no point in joining their ranks, aye? One last tip from this former OTR driver who used to transport hazardous waste to registered treatment facilities clear across the continent: teach yourself to RIDE THE GAP whenever possible, which means positioning your vehicle between packs of other vehicles on the road. You obviously can't do this all the time, but you can MAXIMIZE YOUR TIME IN THE GAP, thereby enhancing your safety. I actually employ this technique to this day, speeding up or slowing down as necessary to ride the gap, it's the safest location on the road.I could go on here, but this is a climbing website... and I'm a long-winded bastard once I really get started, LOL. A few parting observations: put together a kit of tools specific to repair of YOUR vehicle, then keep that kit aboard your rig whenever you are on the road. Appropriate wrenches, screwdrivers (not the kind with vodka in 'em), vise-grips, pliers, razor knife, etc., and toss in zip-ties, electrical tape & duct tape, they all come in handy when effecting repairs. A multimeter is nice, but you can live without one... jumper cables are essential and should never leave your trunk or cab. Carry multiple jugs of water with you, along with oil, wiper fluid, etc., anything you think might be helpful in an emergency. Extra clothing and blankets never hurt. If you blow a tire, don't use the shoulder unless it's plenty wide, better to roll slowly to the next exit or pull off the road entirely, even if you're in a field or wherever... the shoulder can be a dangerous location, especially at night. I'm sure you've all read articles about tow truck drivers getting killed: that's a dangerous occupation, and the death stats prove it.OKAY, ENOUGH TEDIOUS SERMONIZING FOR THE DAY, BY RIGHTS I SHOULD NOW BE DRINKING COLD BEER AT MY HOUSE, LOL.

116758638,"May 22, 2019",Mark Webster,"I would add to the other great ideas on here a few I've used in my many solo road trips. One that hasn't been mentioned is to stay up to date on the regularly scheduled maintenance on your car. A well maintained car doesn't break down. And if you don't know what your car needs, take it to an honest mechanic and have them either do the work, or tell you what to do...if you work on cars.If you are fortunate enough to drive a stick, you can carry some old rope for when your car won't start. There may not be enough people around to push start it, but the rope allows for a pull start.Just this last spring I got stuck in some mud right off a lonely pass in North West Nevada. They could see my car, and that I was stuck, but no one would stop...until I lit some old fashioned road flares. Carry those...people notice them burning and will stop.I second the notion on bear spray. I also carry a length of 1.5 inch x 20 inch pipe. It's a weapon for self defense and doubles as leverage when you can't get your tire lug nuts off. I am likewise not a fan of hand guns. Concealed carry permits often don't cross state lines. And guns are just over kill in most situations. Kids and drunken partners can find and play with them...it ends badly.When possible, try to camp near other travelers. Look for members of the ""tribe"". By that I mean, other dirtbags with rocket boxes on the top, bicycles and kayaks on the roof...if you climb you know the look.If you travel with a laptop, and or like to hike and leave expensive climbing racks or cameras in the car, it's handy to have some kind of a lockable box in the car. Then lock the box to a car seat with a bike cable. It slows down the smash and grab thieves. Mine is made from nice plywood, drape a towel over it to cover the locks.There are new sat phone messenger devices coming out all the time, worth looking into. Some of them allow you to buy minutes, like a prepaid phone. Another much older option is a hand held ham radio. 8 year old kids have passed the ham test to get the license. You can learn it online. They can reach out 50 miles line of sight, only cost $60 and can tap into repeater nets (similar to cell towers) that allow you to talk up to 300 miles, to ask for help. I was able to talk to someone in Spokane from Seattle, via a repeater in the Cascades, on a little ham walkie talkie. You would need to program in the repeaters along your projected travel route, but it's relatively easy. They also make great radios for multipitch in noisy territory. They are as powerful as what is carried by law enforcement.Oh, and check your spare tire now and then, they can lose pressure slowly and are easily overlooked. One last thing: keep a spare key in your wallet and hidden under the car.  Use a wing nut and some big washers to bolt it through an existing chassis hole. Smear mud on it and it will disappear.",1,Tacoma,Nov 2008,Points: 230,4.217785843920145
116758638,"May 22, 2019",Stiles," I like to get way solo when sleeping, so any noise alerts you.  This works out great, cause you seek out free camping in the woods, and not pay camping surrounded by everybody else. And 'combat park', backed in and ready to high-tail outa there. Have the bear spray, but run rather than use it. I dont think you want a gun for lotsa reasons. I also prefer sleeping in the open right beside my rig, as being outside is the point, right? Check your oil and fluids everytime you fuel up.  Block ice lasts way longer in the cooler than cubed. Cover your cooler with your puffy.  A silk liner for your sleeping bag.  A couple of cheap tarps and a hundred feet of cord. Full size spare tire, not a donut. 5lb fire extinguisher that Real easy to grab averts major disasters. And a small shovel for digging cat holes. Baby wipe on your face/pits, and then your bottom.

115387497,"Oct 4, 2018",Josh Janes,"The film captures an imperfect relationship and contrasts it with a moment of profound perfection (Honnold's free solo), and suggests that the perfectionism that drives him might be deeply rooted in his childhood. To me, this portrayal (both of Alex and of his relationship with Sanni) seemed very honest and human. The fact is that Sanni is (or was at the time of filming) an inexperienced noob partnered to one of the most experienced climbers on the planet - it's no surprise that there are going to be problems. Personally, I found the moment of her getting tangled in the rope to be hilarious. I don't see how this has anything to do with gender; if their genders were reversed, it would have been equally amusing. Keep in mind the movie is about Alex after all - all the other players are just there to help fill in the story.Also interesting: The portrayal of Sanni as fawning and infatuated, unable to see the important difference between accepting Alex's lifestyle and choices (ie loving him), and wanting to change him or mold him into who she'd rather him be (ie more domestic and more conservative in his climbing). Meanwhile Alex is single-minded in his goal - insinuating that Sanni might be the cause of his injuries, blaming her for being a distraction, and booting her out of his van and out of the Valley as the pressure rises. This is not exactly a flattering picture of Alex - even if, as climbers and members of a goal-oriented society, we can admire him for his focus.I found it surprising that Alex and Sanni would be so willing to be so candid and vulnerable about allowing the world this glimpse into their relationship, but on the other hand it is true to form to Alex's compulsion to be brutally honest at all times. Again though, I don't see how this has anything to do with gender; their roles could easily have been reversed. Regardless, I found this relationship dynamic to be almost as interesting and tense to watch as Alex's free soloing - albeit for very different reasons but both in sort of a ""I can't watch... but I can't NOT watch"" way.",69,Unknown Hometown,Jun 2001,"Points: 9,887",4.610810810810811

I may think I’m correct all the time, but that will do nothing except destroy our relationship. So the key is to settle on something we’re both ok with. Same with climbing partners, I may be perfectly fine with two quick draws as an anchor on a sport route, but if I have someone who prefer me build a quad anchor, I’ll do it even if I think it’s way too much. As long as my partner’s method is not unsafe, I will make the compromise because it’s also about feeling safe when climbing (even if it’s over the top safe).

If OP's SO didn't know that belaying directly off a harness was safe, then there's a much bigger problem--a lack of intentionality, of knowledge, and a willingness to be cavalier about safety. That would be the problem, not what happened in this one instance.So the case may be that your SO is doing things the climbing community considers to be safe, but which are not within your boundary of acceptable risk. I had a partner once who would get touchy if I took him off belay without telling him, even if I could see he was already clipped into the anchor.

115320711,"Sep 15, 2018",Lisa S,"I work at my university’s climbing wall, and last year my female co-workers and I started a Women's Night to address issues one of my coworkers noticed, and since then I've thought a lot about barriers women face in climbing. Here are some I’ve thought about:Indoor climbing is a unique sport in that beginners climb right next to experts. When you first start jogging, you’re not forced to run next to someone who runs a 5 minute mile, but yet that’s probably what it feels like when a V0 is a challenge and someone flashes a V6 next to you. I feel like women are especially prone to self-comparison like this.When you first start climbing, you naturally think its all about strength. The average woman has less strength than the average man. This can be discouraging, and can also mean there’s less routes a complete beginner woman can climb than a complete beginner man, which is also discouraging.When our smallish boulder is crowded as it often is, and there’s five or more climbers taking turns on a section, beginners (particularly women) don’t have the confidence to “get in there” and actually take a turn on the wall much at all - especially when you don’t have a sense for how the etiquette works, everyone else is keen to hop on too, and when you climb and probably flail, you know you have plenty of eyes on you, and you probably get embarrassed. I’ve watched new women come to the boulder and get on maybe twice before leaving, probably for good, in situations like these. Maybe this has to do with how women are socialized in our culture. So this is more of a theory than something I’ve observed. Almost every woman I know who climbs seriously has a boyfriend who also does. Due to the gender imbalance in climbing, this makes sense. But the problem is that when you’re a beginner climber, you need mentors to help teach you technique/strategy in order to improve, and of course partners. A lot of women feel most comfortable when another woman is in this role, but if all the ladies are out climbing with their boyfriends (as I’ll admit I often am, he’s for sure my most comfortable, enjoyable partner - duh!), who’s going to partner and mentor the newbies? Hopefully a kind dude or the rare available lady, but very often it’ll be a guy that’s interested in being more than just a climbing partner. To have the patience to leave your buddies and climb with someone several grades lower than you is usually motivated by something. And thus, this makes improving at climbing less accessible for women who aren’t interested in or available for flirting or romantic relationships.Note that ALL of these are independent of men treating women negatively directly, which I think what most male climbers envision when they think of barriers to female climbers. This can obviously be an issue too, though not one I’ve experienced directly.I’m curious what other barriers anyone else has noticed to female climbers, please add if you’d like!Side note - to do what I can to help other women overcome these, I try to approach new women at the wall with friendliness and a lot of guidance, encouragement, and helpfulness, and encourage lots of questions and communication. Women's Night once a week where we staff only females and encourage females only has been really effective in improving the number of women who climb here, as we keep a super open, beginner-friendly, no judgement atmosphere that has shown to be just what lots of ladies need to get into climbing.Edit: Wow this has blown up a lot more than I expected it to, especially since I was expecting comments to be input from other women sharing experiences they’ve seen or know of that have discouraged them or other from climbing - which has compromised exactly zero comments.I guess I’m glad this has stirred the pot a little bc I’ve gotten some good food for thought and it seems other have too. But I think this is really just the beginning of the conversation- these are some of my thoughts on my experience, and I have plenty of other of thoughts on women who climb that I haven’t solidified “arguments” for that would certainly get destroyed by male MP commenters. So, maybe some other woman will be brave enough to share them.         ",51,"San Luis Obispo, CA",Dec 2015,Points: 26,4.711956521739131

My 2 cents: make fun the intention, not take this or any sport too seriously, laugh and learn when you flail, watch and ask for help and realize the growth opportunity that how you approach the challenges of climbing are also likely how you approach other challenges in life.

115320711,"Sep 16, 2018",Anonymous,"The type of climbing can influence the frustration factor with beginners.  With indoor boulder climbing newbie guys can have an advantage over women because many easy boulder problems can be overcome with raw strength.  Of course relying on raw strength will ultimately be a hindrance, but it can give one some initial success that gives a boost of confidence. Newbie women often do better on outdoor slab because men naturally try to use strength where it will be counterproductive.  The goal of a 50/50 outcome ratio has always puzzled me. Initially is sounds reasonable but it has so many assumptions built in. It's also applied arbitrarily. Should we be concerned about these ratios with every aspect of life? If it is important to balance ratios in sports and hobbies, what about far more serious matters like workplace deaths or the prison population?If women want more women to climb, I think there's nothing wrong with them creating venues for that to happen. Women-specific events, whatever.  And it's ok to do these things for selfish reasons, like a desire to have more women partners.

When I got to the gym environment, I met a lot of fantastic climbers, of both sexes who were really encouraging and mentored me. Fast forward to now and many of those partners have gone their own ways in life so my partner dance card has regrettably dried up. But of those I climbed with more often than not I have found the women to be better, more encouraging partners. Not to say the men haven't, some of the best people I have learned much from were men. But the women were more encouraging, and not in a cheerleader way, but in a positive and constructive tone (coach-like).

Evolution is likely the driving force, but culture seems also to play a significant role. I’m open to being shown otherwise if my thinking is amiss.I think alpine skiing is another good example. High risk, presumably equal number of participants through all levels. I don't think that climbing automatically equates to having a similar risk profile as base jumping or bullfighting. Sure, speed climbing and alpinism -- but single pitch rock climbing is reasonably low consequence.My opinion of course, but I would be pretty surprised if there weren't equal or greater numbers of women sport climbing than men in coming years. I think bouldering and sport climbing are much more relatable to gymnastics than base jumping.Sort of aside the point - multi pitch and trad climbing are really interesting to me because they are basically bouldering (yeah, yeah...) but with added layers of logistics, technical problem solving and management of complex systems on the fly. Basically, women kick ass at all of these things IME, and often work much harder at them than men do, so I really do wonder if it is a generational/education thing where in 20 years you watch the next 15yo female phenom send the first .16a climb on gear (or whatever equivalent, maybe not a Baffin solo but that'd be badass) or the alternative would be that continued hesitation to engage in risky behavior.To paraphrase - our culture treats women real wierd. I really wonder if it's mostly culture.Edits for clarity. Anecdotally I know some badass women climbers so that could be biased. Also wanted to add that I think rugby and bullfighting are likely deeply tied to male evolutionary history, so it is somewhat unsurprising women aren't as enticed.Something, something ... you could stretch that argument to exploration and mult-pitch climbing but my gut tells me that drive is entirely human and that the reason I question whether or not women have it is, once again, because of our sexist cultureAaand as long as I'm tacking on edits - I do want to respectfully say that as a male with anxiety and wavering self confidence the op certainly described my personal barriers to entering climbing (and skateboarding as a child). I did learn outside, and likely wouldn't be a climber if I was introduced to the sport in a busy bouldering gym expressly because of those social barriers.It's so important that we are understanding and encouraging of new climbers!

Shift what was a negative experience into, hopefully, useful beta and system changes to make it more difficult for folks to be targeted with partners whose primary intentions do not involve climbing2. Bring awareness on how to navigate meeting climbing partners - applicable to all folks but from the perspective of a younger female climber3. Determine if the suggested changes are supported by the greater climbing communityIn summary, sexual harassment and objectification took on a whole new level of vulnerability on the rock. I was naive to think this was an isolated incident. I recently came to find out a fellow younger lady climber also had a negative experience with the same person - and thus the pattern revealed itself: this person targets younger female climbers for activities unrelated to climbing, and in my experience, becomes aggressive when events don't go his way.I have a few suggestions to make it more difficult for jerks using the partner forum with intentions unrelated to climbing:1. The Mountain Project platform provides the option to hide your age - MP administrators have already replied positively to this suggestion, but the changes have not been implemented. I'm of the opinion that ability and goals, and not age, serve as a better indicator of a good climbing match. In the mean time, I would offer to other younger lady climbers to list your age arbitrarily as 40 or 50 to discourage targeting.2. The MP platform provides a rating/comments system for climbers (similar to Lyft, Couchsurfing, etc.) to provide a space for partners to record positive/negative experiences. Of course, there are ways around this, such as making a new account, but it would make it more difficult for the intended party.Please feel free to comment on suggestions 1 and 2 and more generally, if you've had a similar experience and have words of wisdom to pass along.

116096352,"Nov 14, 2018",Sandi Bourne,"Hi everyone, I'm wondering if any of you have had this experience:Your significant other wants you to try climbing something you're not comfortable doing, like multipitch or trad, and refuses to accept that you're really not interested at all. The main reason I get from my significant other is that I haven't tried it, so how could I know that I won't like it? (I've done some sport and one fixed-line two-pitch 5th-class scramble before and my fear of heights has always outweighed the fun of the situation, really kills the stoke everyone has)While I'm always down to try new (lowball!) bouldering routes, I'm really not ready to get into trad, multipitch, or maybe even sport climbing. Mostly because I'm afraid of heights and I'm really not that interested in pushing those boundaries (though I'm stoked to hear of women pushing their boundaries). I might be down in the future, but it seems it's important to him that I try it sooner than later. I'm super supportive of his need to do that stuff, and I'm more than happy to come along and be a base camp manager or first-pitch belay slave or meet him up at the top. But he's always trying to get me to go because he wants to share that part of his life with me. I've been able to avoid it by chance so far, but it's becoming a problem in our relationship.Have any of you had this sort of experience? What are your thoughts?

Just to cover bases, from the climbing perspective: I firmly believe that climbing, and especially leading need to be intrinsically motivated. If someone is psyched to learn to climb or lead or get on bigger climbs, I'm psyched to help them get there. And in the larger context of everyone is happy to be out climbing, a little pushing at times between trusted climbing partners is sometimes a wonderful thing. But no good will come of putting yourself or others into a potentially risky situation you have no interest in. Your disinterest in climbing higher than a pitch or a boulder problem is 100% valid. And if you find on reflection that even that much doesn't interest you, that's absolutely ok too. From the relationship perspective: No one outside a relationship can really know what's going on for you, only you can really decide what's right for you. So just some things to consider: Does he act like this in any other facet of your life, unrelated to climbing? Controlling, badgering, not taking no for an answer, is this a constant? If so, it may be worth considering whether this relationship in its current state is a healthy one for either of you. If he doesn't, and this is solely a climbing thing, then maybe he's a reasonable and caring guy who is just over-focused on getting you to climb for whatever reason. Maybe you can talk about why it's so important to him, that he would ignore your feelings and try to push you into something you don't want, when you're already meeting him more than halfway. If you can figure out what's at the root of this, maybe he can fill that need in another way, or come to an understanding that climbing is truly never going to be for you what it is for him; or maybe this is a deal-breaker for you both.Let us know how it turns out if you're so inclined.

I would like to hear what you have to say in regards to women's pants- specifically pants marketed for climbing and heavy-duty outdoor excursions. What do you love about them? What do you hate about them? What do you want in your ideal pair?Personally, as a wide-shouldered, long-torsoed, tomboy sorta gal, I have these frustrations: way-too-form fitting tops, bottoms that don't stretch enough and items that bunch up/ride up in all the wrong places. In addition, I love me some earth tones and am frustrated with the pink/lavender saturation we encounter as female consumers. Give me ochres, yellows, burnt oranges, emeralds, heck, maybe even a loud chartreuse. No more Easter-pastel-only palettes. (That being said, if anyone has a favorite pair of high-waisted women's climbing pants they'd like to recommend...) Thanks all!",3,SLC,Jan 2017,Points: 173,5.208333333333333

It is just me though, maybe mental/force of habit. There are crusher women (e.g. Alex Puccio, just to name one) who climb in E9s, and do not have any problem throwing heel hooks over head.

It is complicated though, if you listen to route setters being interviewed during IFSC comps, they constantly are mentioning how they attempt to make routes ""fair"" by balancing the number of reachy moves with cramped moves, or adding multiple foot options. A combined format would make this job even harder.In IFSC lead world cup in Xiamen last year there was rain that soaked through the wall in such a way to make the women's route unclimbable, but the men's route was untouched. They cancelled the women's semi-final. It really annoyed me, since it seemed like there existed the obvious solution of using the men's route, and no one even brought up this possibility.

Setters are starting to use dynamic sequences for lead, I even remember a fig 4 sequence. Many transitions are set to be challenging in a couple of ways at the same time - tiny holds and controlled or semi-dynamic sequences at the limit of reach, bigger holds with  more dynamic or compression based, again at limits of reach. Statistically, women are shorter than men, and have less reach, they would be disadvantaged from the start. There were a few routes this season that shorter competitors could not do even on women routes, while the taller ones just cruised through. Same applies to men - Ramon was shut down quite a few times because he physically could not do a sequence due to his shorter stature.Transition to the new style of climbing seems to be very morpho dependent.It is likely someone will remember comps of yesteryear when women and men competed on the same routes. It would be impossible right now - the fields are very tight, based on climbing on the rock women are 2-3 grades behind at redpoint, not sure about onsights, and plastic is even more restrictive.",1,"Nowhere, OK",Feb 2012,Points: 20,4.760765550239235

I’ve been using an old headlamp strap with two small non lockers that get clipped to the primary micro’s locker on either side of the device to keep it upright and centered. One option for backing up the system you’re using now would be to basket hitch a sling to your belay loop and clip a microtrax to it that trails below the grigri.

How could I best advocate for female climbers in this context? Does anyone have personal experience with this?Your gym needs to look at their practices and hiring. College age, there seems to be plenty of lady climbers. The male/female ratio is shifting. Does the gym allow voluntary setters? If so, start recruiting. If not, start advocating. Are outside climbers allowed? Invite the ladies you know. Just being visible puts the idea in the head of others that, ""hey, maybe I can do that!"" Do the orientation tours include the climbing wall? Try to be there when that happens. I don't think a ""ladies night"" is a bad thing, but it also is probably not the best idea. Ladies groups are better, IMO, when you get to a certain skill level, like ready to go into gear, or try ice climbing. At a university? It can also send the message, again just my opinion, that women need ""more"" somehow, or are less capable.Now, a routesetting clinic that addresses the fact ​of women climbers? Yes! Also all the other users the university should be aiming to entice into the gym.

Nearly all the routes are set by men, and nearly all the advanced climbers/lead climbers seen regularly at the wall are men. Some women (students and community members), especially those new to climbing, have told me this is intimidating for them.Kari, here's my personal experience as an old feminist climber, who started climbing at a time before gyms existed and when most other climbers were men:The men who went out of their way to mentor me when I first started were welcoming and friendly and treated me as an (inexperienced) equal.  They never made me feel intimidated.  So the first place the management of your gym could start is to make sure that all the staff is welcoming and friendly and respectful and attentive to whomever walks in the door.  Even if the staff of the gym is 100% SWyoungM, if they have the right attitude, any woman, or old person, or gay person, or non-white person will feel welcome.  If the staff is scornful of beginners with a shirtless dude/bro mentality, lots of new climbers could be put off.Having all the routes set by men is problematic if they are not aware of the differing strength of new women climbers.  Reachy, juggy, thugy, bouldery routes can be frustrating to newer women climbers.  And inexperienced route setters for gyms with shorter walls tend to set more of these kinds of routes to achieve harder grades with limited height to work with.  I first met the great Valley climber Barry Bates when he was setting routes for the REI Sunnyvale wall (all of about 20 feet high?) back in the 80s.  He was able to set routes on that wall that were equally challenging to men and women. Raise awareness and skill in your routesetters.  Ladies nights are a great idea, as are Beginners nights.  You don't have to offer any discounts, and you don't have to close off the gym to other people.  If it's marketed as a way to meet other people as potential future partners, that should be enough to attract people.  And inviting in well known and experienced climbers to do clinics for beginners would be a great thing to offer. That you certainly could charge a fee for.   It's not like there is any shortage of great climbers in Colorado.Best wishes, Phyl        ",15,Upland,May 2015,"Points: 1,097",4.619164619164619

As Katie mentioned, women's baselayers aren't compatible. The reality is that the tube part is pretty short and I always feel like I'm going to pee on my bulky bunched up pants. Also - beware of peeing out the back of the funnel. It happens. Make super sure you have a good seal before you start to pee. I feel like I have to lean forward to make sure it runs out the funnel.

I like the Freshette specifically because it is rigid, but I have heard others cite its rigidity as a downside.  When I have on underpants, base-layer, shell, and harness, I unzip the fly of my shells and push down my underwear and baselayer waistbands.  I feed the funnel in from below my harness.  The waist-bands will want to push the funnel up, pinching it into the top of my fly, but because the Freshette is rigid, I can hold it firmly and use the bottom of it to hold my waistband down.  I hope that makes sense.  It sounds like the p-style works well for some people, but from the way I use the Freshette, I can't even see how the p-style works.  I definitely want my pee completely enclosed for its journey to the outside of my clothing. The tube slides in and out, so you have to set it firmly before using it.  I find the main body is long enough that the base of it remains outside of my pants.  The tube is flexible and you can kind of aim it.  It is long enough that your pee can land reasonably far in front of you.  I haven't had any problems with the modular design, and it does make it more compact for storage.  That said, I guess you have to touch it, and if you pee and then push the tube back inside there is probably some residual urine on the outside of the tube when you pull it out next time.  You can also easily slide the tube into a narrow-mouthed bottle for tent-bound peeing. I keep it in a zip-lock and then stuff-sac and usually just wash it at the end of a trip.  I like the sock idea! On multi-day trips I try to be better about rinsing it in the evenings. The major issue I have with a funnel is that my body is not good at relaxing my ""pee muscles"" when I am standing up.  To trick my body, I bend forward at the waist, so I am crunched in the middle as I would be when squatting.  I'm sure this is a very personal thing, but for me it has never been easy to start the stream when I am standing, even in private situations.",1,"Boston, MA",Sep 2010,Points: 0,4.064356435643564

True, the tube needs to be set well and its always a good idea to practice using it with anything you plan on wearing before heading out into the field. Some pants have long zippers and others don't. It's good to know which pants are more convenient.

115138882,"Aug 27, 2018",Aerili,"Hello all, I am considering buying a set of Petzl ascenders off a friend. They are an older model but only one of the two was used (very lightly) as far as I can tell and not for climbing. Not sure exactly how old they are but I believe it was a time when they cost ~40% less than now (weighs 196 g).  My hesitation to buy them is that I am concerned about thumb injuries when using them repetitively due to the size (see pics). Now I realize that a) I would normally be wearing gloves, and b) I can wrap padding and tape around the handle to bulk it up, but I'm still a bit concerned about the thumb action anyway since my hand would have to ride high to reach the release - and the release action of ascenders has always been tough on my thumbs due to the range of motion required (I also have ligamentous laxity which helps....nothing). I have also started experiencing extreme thumb soreness (thenar eminence) when doing any activity which requires gripping statically or repetitively. I think this may be due to autoimmune disease as this never occurred for me in the past, and it's an animal unlike DOMS. I've had extreme soreness from simply long days hiking with trekking poles and climbing ice too.  Any recommendations on smaller ascender options out there?Are newer Petzl models more ergonomic for small hands?Otherwise, recommendations on adapting an ascender to a smaller hand?I realize the pictures below aren't exactly representative of the exact hand postures you would encounter with the ascender being used on a rope overhead, but it gives you an idea of how reachy the geometry is for female hands I think.Fingers seated in grooves - can't reach the releaseHand riding high and stretching to reach the release - my hand could slide higher to reduce the extreme thumb posture, but then it's mostly on the metalPulling down - it's hard to tell in this photo, but my proximal IP joint in my thumb is fairly hyperextended         ",1,"Los Alamos, NM",Mar 2007,"Points: 1,875",4.625

From my perspective, equipment is/should be made to fit the ergonomics of the people using it. Some companies approach this better than others, or research the biomechanical use of the product better than others for a broad range of anthropometrics. I'm sure most ascenders are designed for men (i.e. larger hands to start with) who are wearing some degree of glove bulk. There may not be a market for manufacturing a product in a smaller size, but I bet any company which makes ascenders could improve their ergonomic and biomechanical research regardless when approaching new designs. And yes, I've done a fair amount of professional biomechanical research and application so I'm definitely biased....or shall we say enlightened.   ",3,"Los Alamos, NM",Mar 2007,"Points: 1,875",5.02020202020202

They're light, very stretchy, and can be cinched at the bottom. I have the odd combination of a small waist and speed skater thighs (literally, I do the sport), and the Ferrosi are one of the very few pants I've found that fits well everywhere without having to sacrifice functionality, comfort or style. OR used to make a long version of it, but I'm not sure what the inseam measurement is. It also seems to have discontinued, so might be difficult to find. Moosejaw still carries a limited selection of sizes/colors for the long version.The brand Kuhl makes short, regular and long inseam versions for a number of their pants. Depending on the model, the pants will have some sort of cinching or roll-up system that allows you to securely shorten the legs when needed. The long inseam is only 34"", but it might still be worth trying on some of their pants since brands sometimes deviate from their size charts.Another alternative is to find a pair of pants that fits you well, regardless of whether or not it has leg cinches, and ask someone with decent sewing skills to put in elastic (jogger style) or drawstrings. If you want the bungee-style cinch cords with toggles, you might have to go to a specialist like Rainy Pass Repair.

So at the end of the day time came to say good-byes, we were heading out to eat at a restaurant in town, and I asked him if he wanted to join us.

114278734,"Apr 20, 2018",Derek DeBruin,"Alpinist Magazine, The American Alpine Club, and the Access Fund are distributing a survey on the occurrence of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the climbing world with the goal of quantifying the extent of these problems.Responses are important, whether or not you've experienced sexual harassment or assault. The survey is anonymous, quite brief, and does not require details unless the respondent wishes to provide them.Survey is here:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUeLKkTx_5PEDmod9yqq-V5IjY8WN3ZhFvgFsTRLFoAwjzVQ/viewformDetails are here:http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web18s/newswire-sexual-harassment-surveyNote: I recognize that sexual assault and harassment are not exclusive to women. However, I have posted this in the women's forum as these issues disproportionately affect women. Further, I know that this forum is more actively moderated than others, which I'm hoping might curtail any particularly vitriolic comments.Edited to add:For methodological concerns, here's a few peer-review journal articles posted downthread on reducing selection bias in internet survey response sampling:https://www.jstor.org/stable/27919830?seq=14#page_scan_tab_contentshttps://file.scirp.org/pdf/OJEpi_2015070913284831.pdfOne of the author's contact information is also available at the Alpinist link above for further direct queries/concerns.For clarity about what constitutes rape, the federal Uniform Crime Report has a pretty good definition: https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape Legal definitions for sexual assault vary by jurisdiction but generally include non-penetrative physical acts of a sexual nature.Summary of a previous though less rigorous survey of gendered experiences in climbing: https://www.outsideonline.com/2099921/how-gender-affects-your-experience-climbing-gymThe incidence of rape and sexual assault in the U.S. is quite high, affecting 1 in 5 to 1 in 6 women and approximately 1 in 71 men. Consequently, it is likely that sexual harassment and sexual assault exists in climbing as it is not likely that climbers are any more or less aware of these issues or more or less likely to perpetrate sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape. Summative U.S. data here:https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violencehttps://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdfI recognize that while mountainproject is based in the U.S., there are users from elsewhere in the world. Worldwide data suggests an incidence of sexual assault as high as 1 in 3 women:http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-womenRegarding incidence of PTSD following sexual assault:PTSD is defined here: https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd-overview/dsm5_criteria_ptsd.aspEstimations of the rate of PTSD following sexual assault vary from as low as 38% of female survivors to as high as 95% of female survivors. See:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323517/#b10-mjm0902p111http://www.facesofptsd.com/rape-ptsd/https://www.rapevictimadvocates.org/what-you-need-to-know/effects-of-sexual-violence/ I'd exhort everyone to keep the conversation respectful and productive. Given the above numbers, there is a very strong chance that those participating in this thread have directly experienced sexual harassment and sexual assault and I'd ask we keep that in mind and be sensitive to this throughout the thread.Finally, if you've experienced sexual assault and wish to speak to someone about your experience, the national sexual assault hotline is 1-800-656-4673.https://www.rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline",16,Unknown Hometown,Jul 2010,"Points: 1,038",7.869879518072289

I think it helped that I went to a climbing ""destination"" (Viñales), and stayed where other climbers were likely to be staying. If I were to offer advice, it would probably be that -- to go to climbing-specific destinations, and stay where other climbers are probably staying. Smith Rock, Indian Creek, RRG, etc. At RRG, for example, you would probably find it pretty easy to meet people to climb with if you camp or just hang out at Miguel's. There will probably be a few groups around who have an odd number and would welcome a competent +1. Like, camping in Rifle specifically is probably a better plan than just going to Boulder and hoping to find partners...somehow? You could also just hike to some crags with your gear and look for friendly people. Offering to give a few catches first is always appreciated, and if the vibe is good and the group is friendly / not in a hurry or seriously working projects, they might invite you join them for the day.You could also obviously try the MP Partner Finder if you're comfortable with that.

Find out where climbers hang out at your destinations of choice, some places are easier than others for finding partners... and maybe make plans to meet up with someone for the first day or two. What I've done is, I'd plan to get to the place on a weekend, and I would try to find partners for the first weekend ahead of time, online. And then once I'm there, it goes really easily, you just talk to people at the crag, and if someone mentions that they are on a longer trip, not just for the weekend, ask if you can climb with them the next day. You have a chance to see them belay, etc. and if they are climbing at the same crag as you, chances are their climbing skills match yours and you would be a good fit.

They are the most asymmetric climbing shoes I know for the (little) amount of down turn. Should be relatively easy to find now that REI carries those.

He noted that it's highly likely that there is large genetic component at play - I agree.In the past year, I've gotten bigger strength gains from focusing on nutrition - particularly pre, during and post workout. I highly recommend Stacy Sims book Roar, which focuses on nutrition and training for female athletes, incl. the impact of hormone cycles on nutrition needs and training, and propensity to injury. There is a section on menopause (as well as pregnancy, and monthly cycle). Following some of the concepts, I feel stronger than ever before, even if I do not have any noticeable muscle. Most importantly, I've avoided further injuries.I do strength training 4x a week (2x upper body; 2x lower) just to maintain.

For women, regardless of pre-or-post menopausal,  it's even more difficult.Also, nobody just bulks up overnight. If you're that rare easy gainer and are going to bulk up from weights it's still not going to sneak up on you.No worries that you'll become the next Aleks.",3,"Los Angeles, CA",Jan 2016,Points: 11,5.005813953488372

No, not taking testosterone, yes, just asking about the shift in hormone balance.I'm choosing to climb at the indoor gym, rather than go to a regular gym, and I am most definitely getting stronger. But, clothes are getting tighter too. The climbing is akin to lots of reps with light weights, versus, few reps with heavy weights, so that is perhaps also part of the equation.Thanks for the replies, all!

My sister, on the other hand...she thinls about lifting a barbell and gets muscular.  I love CF because it is about over all functional fitness.  Anyone who does it 3-5 days a week shpuld look the way the body is supposed to, provided they change eating habits.  When you see a bulky lifter, it is because they are spending 8 hours a day in a gym and using supplements.  That is not natural, not even for men hope that helps some.",0,"Yucca Valley, Ca",Jul 2007,Points: 25,4.142857142857143

However, it's very hard work and it's not for everyone.  Also, it's really important to avoid injury as we get older since we don't heal like we used to.",0,Unknown Hometown,Dec 2005,Points: 0,4.593023255813954

114076385,"Feb 12, 2018",Lena chita,"First of all, if I understand you correctly, you aren't doing weight training, like lifting weights and such. You are just talking about climbing. And the muscle gain you are talking about is in your arms and maybe shoulders?That is not a weight/muscle gain big enough to make a significant weight difference. You are not bulking up your legs, which are much bigger/heavier than arms. And the strength.weight ratio is definitely in your favor, if your arms/shoulders are getting more muscled.The likelihood that you will start packing on muscle now, if you haven't before, is very low. Postmenopausal women lose muscle mass, and muscle gains get progressively harder with age, unless you are taking protein supplements and working out like a body-builder, I wouldn't worry.Here's an article where they looked at a postmenopausal women doing progressive resistance training 3 times a week for 12 months.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3560313/There were strength gains, bot not even statistically significant, and no muscle mass gain. They are saying that maybe 3x week of doing 8 sets at 85% 1-RM for the muscle groups they chose (chest press, leg press, upper back, and hip abduction) wasn't enough... And maybe it wasn't. But are you doing anything approaching that, realistically? It doesn't sound like you are, from your vague description. So I wouldn't worry about gaining too much bulk, in your case.",1,OH,Mar 2011,"Points: 1,667",5.367713004484305
114076385,"Mar 12, 2018",Lori Milas,"Just my two cents, Helen... I have taken bioidentical hormones for many years, including estradiol, progesterone and testosterone.  I cannot imagine life without them, nor climbing without them.  I was able to get to one of the best docs in anti-aging and hormones in Los Angeles (Dr. Uzzi Reiss), and I just had a visit with him while I was in town last week.  We discussed 'this new climbing thing' I'm doing... and my desire for strength, agility and endurance.  So, besides reminding me to be fastidious about diet and staying organic, he suggested I add a hormone called SARMs... transdermally.  (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators) which has none of the side effects of testosterone, and can by cycled.    I'm about to be 65.  I do not take any drugs, not even aspirin... and I struggled for years with the decision of whether to use hormones after menopause.  My doctor said ""You ladies got a bum deal from nature. You were never expected to live past 35, so everything shuts down at that point.  What you want is to restore your hormones to a youthful level.""  For me, that absolutely included testosterone. (in balance with estrogen).  Any time I have tried to get by without T my gym workouts and recovery go to hell.  Skin, hair, heart, blood pressure, energy, sex drive... and now climbing... change dramatically when the missing hormones are replaced.  ",0,"Joshua Tree, CA",Apr 2017,Points: 235,4.8405172413793105
